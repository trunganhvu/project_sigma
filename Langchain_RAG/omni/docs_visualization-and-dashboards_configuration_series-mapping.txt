Series Mapping
Any column (dimensions, measures, or calculations) or pivot can be re-arranged in the visualization layer. This allows for the flexible construction of many different types of visualizations over the same data table.
Each facet is presented at the bottom of the visualization configuration under available fields.

Fields can be used across more than one facet by dragging from available fields into the corresponding facet. Alternatively the fields can be moved by grabbing a token and changing the chart. Here are a few examples with our original query:
