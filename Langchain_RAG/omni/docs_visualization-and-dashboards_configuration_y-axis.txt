TIP
These control only the axis itself to customize the series mapped to the axis use the dropdown next to the series/field.
Notes
Reference Lines
Reference lines offer a quick way to set targets on a chart. There is limited configuration for these, so more complex use cases may be better served with table calculations as a regular, independent series.
Other
When tuning axis colors note that there is not independent configuration for light and dark mode. The default palette will adjust colors (ie. dark axis in light mode; light axis in dark mode), but when they are hard-coded they will be respected in light and dark mode.
The configuration can be reset (note, entirely for the viz to defaults) under Tab > Reset Chart
Long-tail axis configuration is available in the Vega-lite spec
