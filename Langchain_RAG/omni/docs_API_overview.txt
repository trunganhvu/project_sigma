API reference
With Omni's APIs, you can programmatically interact with your Omni instance.
Base URL
The API base URL is the same as the URL you use to login to Omni. For example, if you log in using https://myorg.omniapp.co, your base URL will be https://myorg.omniapp.co/api.
Only HTTPS calls are accepted.
Authentication
Authenticate your calls to the API by providing an API key in your requests. Every request made to the API must have an Authentication header with the API key as a Bearer token:
curl -X GET 'https://myorg.omniapp.co/api/scim/v2/users' \
--H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--H 'Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>'
To create an API key, navigate to Settings > API Keys. API keys are only displayed once when created.
NOTE
You must be an admin to see the API keys page.
Note: If you find you don't have access to API keys, reach out to Omni support.
API key expiration
API keys do not expire, but they may be revoked by the user at any time. In the event that your API key is lost or compromised, delete the API key in your Omni instance and create a new one.
Stability
Some APIs contain /unstable in their endpoints, marking them as in development. The APIs may be used, but note that future updates may introduce breaking changes.
Entity Resource URL Version/Status
Models /v0/model v0
Queries /api/unstable/query/run Unstable
Folders /api/unstable/folders Unstable
Documents /api/unstable/documents Unstable
Content migration /api/unstable/documents Unstable
Users /scim/v2/users SCIM 2.0 (Stable)
Groups /scim/v2/groups SCIM 2.0 (Stable)
Rate limiting
The Omni API uses rate limiting to prevent instability as a result of large numbers of simultaneous requests. If you send more than 60 requests in a minute, you may encounter 429 Too Many Requests errors.
If you hit the limit, we recommend implementing a retry mechanism that uses exponential backoff to reduce request volume when needed.
