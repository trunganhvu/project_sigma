Series Configuration
Each series / field offers configuration in addition to the axis configuration. In this area the data itself can be controlled (vs the axis or facet like color). To configure the x-axis or y-axis generally follow the corresponding settings.
X-Axis Series Configuration
The X-Axis configuration offers controls for the label (which mirrors the x-axis label controls). Additional configuration is available for formatting of values (number, percentage, currency, and integer) as well as number of decimals. By default series will mirror formatting in the data table (auto).
Y-Axis Series Configuration
The y-axis configuration will mirror the x-axis configuration with additional controls for labeling data points and trendlines.
Visualization Data Labels
Data labels will show values above each point on the graph. There is currently no control to make the labels more sparse, but future configuration will open that up.
By default points will be labeled with the series in use, but can also reference other fields (ie. labeling an measure-measure XY scatterplot with data labels for the dimension).
Position will move the label vis-a-vis the data point (by default overlaid).
Trendlines / Moving Average / Regression Lines
The analytics configuration offers controls for adding moving averages to charts or regression lines.
There is no current configuration to display the regression formula or r-squared, but will come in the future.
For moving average, the trend line will mirror the order in the table when toggling between center and lagging, so for desired behavior the table may need to be resorted.
For more custom trendlines and moving averages, it's recommended to build calculations in the data table.
