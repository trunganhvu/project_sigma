X-Axis: Title, Sort
Labels:
Show Labels
Show Axis Line
Show Ticks
Font
Format (Label rotation, Ticks (Auto, Number))
Grid: On/Off Checkbox
TIP
These control only the axis itself to customize the series mapped to the axis use the dropdown next to the series/field.
Temporal/Quantitative (Continuous) vs Ordinal (Discrete) Axes
Omni adjusts axis treatment for different data types and visualization types.
For strings - axes will always be ordinal, and, by default, obey sort in the data table.
For numerics - bars are ordinal; line, scatter, area are quantitative (continuous)
For dates - bars are ordinal; line, scatter, area are temporal (continuous)
For the ordinal series, note that missing rows will not be displayed. It's recommended to fill missing rows to retrieve these values when that is desireable.
Axis Labels Spacing
Axis labels will behave differently for continuous / temporal axes (vs ordinal / string). In continuous mode, the labels will be spaced so as not to cut text, but may not align exactly with the visualization points. In ordinal mode, the values will be labeled one-by-one, and hidden in consistent intervals to, again, avoid collision.
There are no current controls for label sparseness, but will come in the future.
Other Notes
When tuning axis colors note that there is not Independent configuration for light and dark mode. The default palette will adjust colors (ie dark axis in light mode; light axis in dark mode), but when they are hard-coded they will be respected in light and dark mode.
The configuration can be reset (note, entirely for the vis to defaults) under Tab > Reset Chart
Long-tail axis configuration is available in the Vega-lite spec
