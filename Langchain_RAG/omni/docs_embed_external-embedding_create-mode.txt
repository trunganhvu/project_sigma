Create mode
Customers donâ€™t just want to see data. They want to interact with it, explore it, and get their own insights, without waiting for a data team to make adjustments. With Create mode for Omni embedding, you can allow your users to create, share, and navigate content as if they were in the native Omni app.
Entities
Create mode uses an entity parameter to isolate embed customers from each other. This ensures that users can only see and share content with other users in their entity. Refer to the Enabling create mode section for an example.
When Omni detects a new entity value, a dedicated, shared folder is automatically created for the entity. Only the entity that the folder was created for can access it. Refer to the User roles & content permissions for more information on controlling user access to content.
Enabling create mode
To enable Create mode for an embedded Omni instance, set the mode embed URL parameter to APPLICATION (mode=APPLICATION). For example:

User roles & content permissions
Two parameters control how embed users can interact with content when in Create mode:
Connection role (connectionRoles), which determines if a user can create content or only consume it
Entity folder content role (entityFolderContentRole), which determines if a user can add or manage content for their entity
Refer to the following table for information about how these roles map and the permission sets they produce.
