What is Omni?
Omni is the business intelligence platform that combines the consistency of a shared data model with the freedom of SQL.
You donâ€™t have to choose between a governed model and agile analysis. Focus on answering data questions, and Omni will build a data model as you go, allowing for reusability, governance, and performance optimization.
Getting Started Resources
Here's a few resources to help get you started:
Check out the example model we've added into your instance called Omni E-commerce Demo. This is a great way to try out Omni on sample data.
Get connected to your own data so you can run queries, create workbooks and dashboards, and share with your team.
