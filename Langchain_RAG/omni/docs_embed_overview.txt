EmbeddingOverview
Embedding
Everyone wants data, but not everyone wants to log into a BI tool to get it. The Omni platform powers embedded dashboards and workbooks for internal use (wikis, Salesforce, Notion, etc) or external consumption (directly in your product with SSO).
Whether internally embedding or externally embedding data, establishing the right infrastructure is key to success.
