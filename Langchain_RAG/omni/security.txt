Secure cloud analytics
Built by a team with years of experience â€” we know how to keep your data secure.
Platform security
Our platform is designed to prioritize the security of customer data. Encryption and isolation are used to keep data and credentials secure, and systems are strictly access-controlled on the basis of least privilege. Penetration testing and vulnerability scanning are used to proactively identify and close vulnerabilities.
Organization security
Our hiring and training processes emphasize data security as our most important job.
Our security program implements rigorous controls to protect customer data, including personnel background checks and regular security training.
Compliance
Our team is committed to maintaining the compliance needed by our customers. This includes annual SOC 2 Type II audits and meeting the standards of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), California Privacy Rights Act (CCPA), and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
