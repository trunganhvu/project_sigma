Ship it: Omni‚Äôs 2024 Product Highlights
Upleveling the basics and doing things a bit unconventionally
December 11, 2024

One of Omni‚Äôs company values is ‚Äúship it.‚Äù This applies to both us and our customers: we move fast, and we want our customers to move fast, too.
In 2024, we did just that: we shipped a lot of stuff. Along the way, we pushed 4,884 commits to Github and shared our progress for everyone to follow with 386 Engineering development demos. Everything we shipped helped us continue on our journey of redefining what great BI looks like by upleveling the basics and doing things a bit unconventionally.
It can be hard to keep track of it all, so keep reading and check out Jamie‚Äôs Omni Live for some of the core areas we tackled and a sneak peek of what‚Äôs coming next üëÄ

What‚Äôs coming next
AI that‚Äôs *actually* helpful ü§ñ
When we built AI capabilities into Omni, we approached it with a healthy amount of both skepticism and optimism. We knew AI could be a helpful tool, as long as it‚Äôs also trustworthy. 
So we designed AI query and calculation agents to speed up your workflows. Not sure where to start when looking at a new dataset? Our Query AI agent can get you started with an answer and give you the tools to keep iterating until it‚Äôs just right. Can‚Äôt remember how to perform a nested IF statement in Excel? Don‚Äôt worry, Calculations AI is an Excel expert. 
Plus, our AI tools are teachable. They consume all the rich metadata that already exists in your data model and can take instruction and additional prompts to help them understand your unique business and data.

Analysis accelerators üí•
Back in my analyst days, I was often running analyses that should‚Äôve been simple, but the tool I was using made it clunky. With Omni, we want to take simple tasks that are annoyingly hard to do and make them delightfully easy. 
For example, period-over-period analyses are such a common use case; they need to be easy for anyone. We‚Äôve made this possible directly from the UI: simply toggle between fields in charts and do period-over-period analysis. You can also bring data from one tab to another with xlookup(), directly reference another cell‚Äôs values, or use one query‚Äôs results to filter another ‚Äì without any complex joins.

Beautifying Omni üé®
We care about design, a lot. We want Omni to be beautiful, and we want to give you the tools to make your Omni outputs beautiful. 
This year we released theming and custom color palettes to give you lots of power to design gorgeous, picture-frame-worthy dashboards (or at least match your corporate branding). We also added beautiful map visualizations and fine-tuned a bunch of visualization configuration controls to help you display data in a way that is just right. 
And for the Omni app itself, we sprinkled in updated colors, layouts, and interactions to make navigation even easier.

Dev workflows that just make sense ‚ö°
BI is just one piece of the data stack puzzle, but that‚Äôs not where our caring about the workflow starts or ends. We want to have the best development workflows so that managing ever-changing data feels seamless ‚Äì within and beyond Omni. 
Since many of our customers use dbt in conjunction with Omni to manage data transformations, we spend a lot of time thinking about what the dbt <> BI workflow should be. To make this possible, we deepened our dbt integration to offer:
Toggling between dev/prod schemas to test the impact of dbt changes
dbt SQL mode, which lets you run dbt SQL (including ref()s) directly in Omni
‚ÄúPush to dbt‚Äù, which allows you to author dbt models from Omni 
A ‚Äúdbt IDE‚Äù that shows your entire dbt repo inside Omni
We also pushed hard on version control options in Omni. For example, you can connect Omni to your git repo to use pull requests to manage your model and store backups of model files (and my personal favorite ‚Äì git blame üòâ). With our new draft/publish workflow, changes can also be staged in a draft before pushing them live. This helps keep your ‚Äúproduction‚Äù content safe while you edit and develop behind-the-scenes. Plus, our model and content APIs allow programmatic, code-based editing of your Omni instance from other applications, opening up more ways to manage Omni as you‚Äôd like.

Embedded analytics your users will love üìä
We love helping our customers build analytics into the apps their team already uses, like Salesforce, and into their customer-facing products. Our work across Omni extends to our embedded analytics offering, including design and beautification controls ‚Äì making it even easier to fine-tune the reports and dashboards you build with Omni to match the look and feel of your own app.
And this year, we wanted to take it a step further so your customers can drill in and interact with their data. Create Mode for embedded analytics allows your customers to go beyond pre-built reports and dashboards to build their own analyses using AI, Excel, and point/click. This lets them get super granular with their data and saves your team from sending ad-hoc reports. Do your customers prefer to receive updates via email? No worries, our embedded deliveries make it possible to schedule and send data directly to the right person‚Äôs inbox.

Admin controls and automations ‚öôÔ∏è
Navigating BI permissions can be a big responsibility for your data team, so we‚Äôve added several features to streamline these processes as much as possible. 
Users can now set their own timezones for date/time fields in Omni (this also lets you provision embed users‚Äô timezones on the fly). And if you have extra tight permissions requirements, SAML-only login mode gives admins even greater control. We‚Äôve also made it easier to understand how your team uses Omni with more detailed usage analytics and the ability to go deeper with ad-hoc analyses. And with so many users needing fresh answers, we know performance optimization is key. So, we released aggregate awareness to help you leverage preexisting, clean data (perhaps transformed by a tool, like dbt) to optimize your queries dynamically for speed.
On the automation front, you can set conditions to receive alerts when the results of a query change. Want to know if traffic increases or inventory is too low? We got you. You can also schedule data deliveries to others via email, Slack, or webhook, and even apply different filters per recipient with email bursting.

What‚Äôs coming next üëÄ
We‚Äôve been busy, and we‚Äôre even more stoked about what‚Äôs coming next year. Of course, we‚Äôll continue investing in the fundamentals. But, we also love creating exciting and novel experiences in the BI layer. Some of our early experiments include:  
Spreadsheets (for real)
Despite all the fancy viz types you can use in Omni, tables are still the most popular. We want to bring the rich spreadsheet experience we know and love from Excel directly into Omni. We‚Äôre working on some early versions and we‚Äôll continue to share more as it develops. 
Product-ized dashboards 
When we share product updates with our customers, the features that make dashboards more engaging often get a ton of hype. We‚Äôre exploring more ways to make dashboards feel like mini-apps that can be used operationally, including dynamic pullout drawers, richer pop-ups, and deeper styling controls. We want to give customers the flexibility and interactions needed to go from dashboard ‚Üí actionable app.
New use cases for AI 
We‚Äôre continuing to test ways to build useful and trustworthy AI into Omni. For example, we noticed that most customers are comfortable writing Excel formulas with arithmetic, but they often use Calculations AI to write longer, more complicated formulas (the longest one was a whopping 10,620 characters, written by AI!). In these tedious scenarios, we think applying AI can be a massive accelerator.
One example is an AI agent for SQL and modeling to help speed up developers building in Omni. This demo shows an early version of an AI ‚Äúcopilot‚Äù that autocompletes code in the SQL editor and model IDE.
Hop aboard the ~ship~ üö¢
We‚Äôre grateful to all our customers ‚Äì their constant feedback helps us ship better and faster. We‚Äôre excited to keep the momentum going next year and can‚Äôt wait to hear what else you‚Äôre looking for. üôå
If any of these features catch your eye and you‚Äôd like to learn more, we‚Äôd love to show you. And you can always catch our weekly engineering demos on our website or follow along on LinkedIn.
