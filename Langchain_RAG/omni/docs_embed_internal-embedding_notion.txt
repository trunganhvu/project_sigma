Embedding Omni in Notion
From the share dialog on a dashboard, copy the embeddable URL.
For notion, you'll then need to strip off the iframe tag, you only want the omni URL in the middle.
E.g. instead of: <iframe src="https://omni.test.embed-exploreomni.dev/dashboards/demo-dash"></iframe>
You will want to just grab: https://omni.test.embed-exploreomni.dev/dashboards/demo-dash
Then in Notion, use the slash command /embed and paste in that URL.
Voila! Omni is embedded in Notion.
Note that users will have to authenticate into Omni when they first see the iframe in a notion doc. This works best on the web version of Notion.
