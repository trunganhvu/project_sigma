SFTP
Omni supports delivery data through SFTP as a robust and secure method for transferring files.
Once the delivery is set up, Omni will automatically encrypt SFTP user's password.
Setup
No prior set up is required to use SFTP as a delivery destination. To create an SFTP delivery, refer to the Creating schedules & alerts guide for instructions.
