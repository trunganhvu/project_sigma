Querying data
To write queries using the pivot-table UI, select fields to query and Omni will automatically begin running queries in the database.
Dimensions and measures are divided into separate sections in the field picker, each nested under individual tables in your data warehouse.
A dimension is a grouping in your query (date, location, type, etc).
A measure is an aggregation over your dimensions (sum, count, average, etc). For example, to query total revenue per day you would select a date dimension (order_items.created_date) and a revenue measure (order_items.sum_revenue).
Here's an example of what that would look like:
There are several advanced actions available on field selection using right click, or using the options menu (three dots) that appears on hover.
Searching fields
Fields can be searched with the input box above the field picker. Default search will hit fields and views. However, you can specify additional conditions using these filter options:
In-use - Limits results to fields in use in the query
Field type - Limits the results to selected data types, such as boolean, number, etc.)
Topic - Limits the results to fields in selected topics
Label - Limits results to fields with or without labels
Descriptions - Limits results to fields with or without descriptions
Additional operators
The search box also supports operators that allow for additional querying options. For example, to limit the field type to date fields, you'd enter data_type:date.
Operator Description Example
data_type: Filters fields based on data type: date, string, boolean, interval, array, json, number data_type:date
is: Filters fields based on whether the field is a dimension, measure, or hidden is:dimension
model_type: Filters fields based on the model type: schema, shared, branch, workbook, query model_type:schema
schema: Filters fields based the schema that contains them schema:marketing
tag: Filters fields based on the provided tag tag:secure
Filtering
Each dimension can be added as a filter to focus on specific rows of data. Different filtering options will be presented for dates, numbers, and strings:
To filter using more than one value (equivalent to using OR), insert a comma between values: [bread, cheese]. If your filter values include commas, you can escape them with \: San Francisco\, CA.
Date filters
NOTE
Filter suggestions are limited to 2,000 rows.
Date filtering offers several filter options, including:
Absolute date filtering, such as 2022, 2023-01-01, 2021-Q4
Relative date filtering, such as after 7 complete days ago, 1 year ago
At times, filtering may require using both absolute and relative dates, for example first ten days of 2023 or 100 days ago for 10 days. For these situations, time for an interval duration offers more flexible time inputs:
The first input should contain the starting point. This value should either be a date (2023-01-01) or a relative date (10 days ago). Note: Ago is required.
The second input should contain the duration.
Check out the following examples to see how it all comes together:
# First ten days of 2023
[2023][10 days]

# 100 days ago for 10 days 
[100 complete days ago][10 days]

# 1 hour ago for 2000 milliseconds
[1 hour ago][2000 milliseconds]
Interval timeframe units
Intervals can accept any timeframe unit:
Interval type Supported units
day day, days, complete day, complete days
week week, weeks, complete week, complete weeks
month month, months, complete month, complete months
quarter quarter, quarters, complete quarter, complete quarters
year year, years, complete year, complete years
millisecond millisecond, milliseconds, complete millisecond, complete milliseconds
second second, seconds, complete second, complete seconds
minute minutes, complete minute, complete minutes
hour hour, hours, complete hour, complete hours
Advanced filtering options
Filtering by another query
With two or more tabs, one tab, or query, can be used as a filter in other queries. This is particularly useful for creating a dynamic subset of information in one query and a deep dive into the results on another tab.
For example, you want to understand the brands your top customers are purchasing. To do this, you would:
In a workbook, create a tab with the definition of a top customer.
Create a new tab.
In the new tab, add the dimensions and measures you want to analyze.
In the field picker, locate a dimension used in the top customer definition tab.
On the dimension, click the options menu (three dots) and select Filter.
Select Is from another query.
In the modal that displays, select the tab and dimension you want to filter by:
This will filter the tab results by the selected subset. In SQL, this generates WHERE clauses that look like WHERE IN (SELECT...) where the SELECT clause is the filtering query.
DID YOU KNOW?
You can also use this approach to filter out data. To do this, select Is not from another query in the Filter menu.
Filtering by multiple conditions
You can filter a field by multiple conditions (e.g. Date is in the past 30 days OR date is null) by clicking Add Condition in the filter modal. Then, select if you want All or Any of the conditions to apply to the query.
Refreshing filter suggestions
In rare circumstances, filter suggestions may be cached in a stale state. To enable the refresh option:
Mac - Hold Command + Shift
Windows - Hold Windows + Shift
Note: The refresh option only clears suggestions for the specific query, not all filter suggestions.
Pivoting
Quickly build pivot tables by right-clicking any field in the field picker and selecting the Pivot option.
Flattening & filtered measures
You can also flatten the pivot and create filtered measures by clicking the actions menu (three dots) on a column and selecting Flatten pivot. When using this feature you can also choose to create an Other bucket on the fly:
The new filtered measures will appear under the query fields and the field that was originally pivoted on will no longer be selected as a field that is in-use.
Creating custom fields
Custom fields can be created through the right click menu or using the + button in the field picker. Refer to the Custom fields guide for more information.
Applying quick aggregates & timeframes
Omni provides a number of aggregations you can apply to fields right from the UI. In the field picker, right click on a field and select Aggregates. Date fields will have an additional Timeframes option.
Field type Dimensions (Timeframes) Measures (Aggregates)

Modeling options
In addition to the above, there are several more menu actions:
Go to definition - Opens the field definition in the model IDE
Hide - Removes the field from the field picker; used for field cleanup
Primary Key - Sets the field as the primary key for the view; used in counts through joined tables
Limiting rows in results
By default, queries will are filtered to 1000 rows of data, but the limit can be adjusted dynamically up to 50,000 rows. Row limits don't impact the rows processed, only the rows available in the Omni UI.
Note: Browsers may have limitations on the amount of data that can be shown at once, so use caution with high row limits.
Column and pivot limits
Omni currently supports any number of measures in the data table. Pivots are limited to 200 columns.
Sorting
Data in the data table can be sorted on a column by column basis, with a cycle through descending, ascending, and unsorted. For sorting over more than one field (secondary sort or double sort), simply sort the first field and hold down shift for subsequent sort actions.
Data table result options
Clicking the Options button while viewing a workbook's results allows you to a number of things:
Column Width - Allows you to automatically or manually set column width
Header Text - Allows you to control how column headers are displayed: clipped or wrapped to the next line
View Names - When enabled, the name of the view the column belongs to will display above the column header
Column Totals - When enabled, totals for each column (measure) will display at the bottom of the table. Refer to the Column totals section for more information.
Row Totals - Applicable to pivot tables. When enabled, totals for each row will display at the far right of the table. Refer to the Row totals section for more information.
Swap Rows And Columns - When enabled, table rows and columns will be transposed. This is useful when measures are needed across rows. Note: Some features, such as column sort, must be set prior to enabling this feature.
Group Measures in Pivot - Applicable to pivot tables. When enabled, measures in a pivot table will be grouped together. Open the toggle below for an example.
Grouped measures in pivot example
Column totals
Enabling column totals adds a Total row at the bottom of the table. From here, you can right click on a measure's total and select Total calculation to customize how the total is calculated.
For example, you have a table that shows total sales by month for 2024. If you wanted to see the average sales across all months, you could change the Total calculation to Average:
Dimension column totals
By default, dimensions - such as dates or IDs - won't have a Total value. However, you can still apply one by clicking the column total and using the Total calculation menu.
Calculation column totals
Columns with calculations applied can also have custom totals. When column totals are enabled, Omni will default to using the column's calculation as the initial total. Take the following table as an example, where the AVG Item Price and CONCAT Average Item Text columns use Excel-like formulas:
Date Order Total Order Items AVG Item Price CONCAT Average Item Text
Jan 2024 $50.00 2 $25.00 Average item price is $25.00
Feb 2024 $100.00 3 $33.33 Average item price is $33.33
Mar 2024 $72.00 6 $12.00 Average item price is $12.00
Totals $222.00 11 $23.44 Average item price is $23.44
In this example:
The AVG Item Price column has a formula of Order Total / Order Items. Using this formula, the column total is $23.44, which is the average of all the values in the column.
The CONCAT Average Item Text column has a formula of CONCAT("Average item price is ", AVG Item Price). Using this formula, the column total value is Average item price is $23.44, which uses the column total for the AVG Item Price column.
Row totals
NOTE
Row totals are only available for queries with at least one pivot.
Enabling row totals adds a Total column to the right of the table. For example, you have products that are sold in the UK and USA. You want to view the total number of returned orders for each country by month, but you also want to calculate the total returns for the month. Creating a pivot table like the following and enabling Row totals will add a column containing this data:
Downloading results
Tab results can be downloaded as a CSV, Excel file, or JSON. Click Tab > Download or the download icon to the left of the Limits menu to get started:
When selecting a file type, keep in mind that:
For Excel, results are limited to 50,000 rows. All formulas are retained.
For CSVs, data can be unlimited as long as all of the following are true:
The combined process of executing the query AND downloading the results doesn't exceed 60 seconds
The tab doesn't contain pivots or table calculations that can't be pushed down to the database (ex: TEXT) aren't used
Otherwise, data will be limited to 50,000 rows.
Use the Advanced options to apply data formatting or specify a row limit.
Removing fields & filters
Fields can be removed from the table either using the field picker (clicking on active fields will remove them) or right-clicking / kebab-icon-clicking in the column's table header.
All views & fields
Most querying will be done through curated topics in the UI, but at times, admins and developers may need access to the full database for ad hoc requests or in order to build new models. All Views & Fields allows those with access the ability to use the pivottable UI to query any table available for a given connection.
The dropdown above the search box offers two options to discover views:
Views from modeled schemas
Each schema in the database
The reason we offer both options is scalability in the data model - if we 'model' thousands or millions of tables in the Omni shared data model, there can be significant performance constraints in building the model and running queries. That said, for smaller schemas (hundreds of tables), you can comfortably model your entire data warehouse without performance considerations, and "View from modeled schemas" will simply reflect the entire warehouse. For customers with hundreds or thousands of schemas or tables, more curation in the data model will reduce clutter, and ad hoc needs across the warehouse can still be achieved through schema selection.
To 'model' a schema, simply touch any view in the given schema (for example, on view Users, add label: Users); this will be done through a curation process like starring in the future
For now, search will only operate inside the selected schema (or across all modeled schemas), so you may have to switch schemas to find the appropriate table if your full warehouse is not modeled. Note this UI will not override Schema Restriction, if the list of schemas has been curated. In the future, we will offer search over all schemas together in addition to schema by schema.
Example
Period-over-period analysis
Period-over-period (PoP) analysis is a business intelligence technique that compares metrics in a recent period to the same period in the past.
You can seamlessly create those time periods from the field picker by selecting ”Period over Period” from the three dot menu of the date dimension you want to use.
Above the results pane two drop downs will appear. In the first drop down, choose the current period and in the second drop down, the period you want to compare. The options to compare will default to relevant time frames; however you can alway customize that logic.
Users will be able to see more exact period parameters in the information icon on the results table.
Filling missing data
Dimension filling
Often when querying with filters, you may return a result set that does not include every possible dimensions, for example count of sales on days with zero sales. It can be valuable to return these missing dimensions for reporting.
After querying a dimension that can be filled (ranged dates, lists), simply right click on the dimension and select 'Fill in Missing Rows'. Note the option may not always appear on dates when Omni does not know the start and end date. To bring the 'Fill in Missing Rows' option, simply filter the date over a clear time period (ie. 2023-01-01 to 2023-02-01), which Omni will then fill in rows for.
In addition to dates, Omni can fill in missing values for enumeration fields - for now, just bins and groups defined in the data model. This may expand over time.
Note that fill is capped at 8000 values, for more complex use cases, direct SQL is recommended.
Pivoted table filling
In addition to filling dimensions, it's often valuable to fill a pivoted table that contains nulls for 'more correct' reporting of aggregates. To replace nulls with 0s in the pivottable, simply select "Fill in Missing Cells in Grid" on a pivoted report:
Joining tables
At times, you may need to join tables in a workbook for richer analysis. To join tables in the workbook, open the Join model from the action menu on any view:
There are three core pieces to configure joins: table and field selection, join type, and relationship:
Adding joins to a topic
For existing joins that are not available in a topic, users will be prompted whether they want to add said join to the active topic.
Join table & field selection
Simply select the table and corresponding fields to join. Right now compound joins or complex logic is not available in the UI, and must be configured in the model interface. Clicking in the table dropdown will also present a search option if there are many tables in the data warehouse.
Join types
Omni offers LEFT, RIGHT, INNER, FULL OUTER, and CROSS joins in the UI.
Join relationships
Join relationships are used to ensure correctness of counts when joins may fan the result set (ie joining many orders to a query about users and counting users). If you know the relationship between your tables, you can select via dropdown. Options include Many to one, One to many, One to one, and Many to many. It is generally recommended to use Many to one joins rather than One to many joins.
For users that may struggle with choosing the correct relationship, when relationship is set to Unknown, the Infer Relationship button will become active. This will examine the cardinality between each join key and select the proper relationship. We recommended using the button, as often uniqueness may not match expectation and this can flag potential data issues like duplicated rows or keys.
Adding controls
Controls allow a user to swap out one field for another on a query making it more dynamic. There are three main types of controls:
Time
Field
Parent
Time controls
These controls will allow you to swap the time frame within the underlying query. This provides an easy UI based mechanism to swap from daily to weekly to monthly and back again, all without any underlying work needing to be done to facilitate it from an administrative perspective. A time frame control can be added from either the field picker or from the date field in the results table by choosing Add Time Frame Selector from the three dot menu.
Field
In order to create a control for dimensions or measures, first add one to the query and switch to the Results view. From there, select the three dot menu on the column and Add field selector. A control will appear above the table with a three dot menu for a user to edit the control (change the label, add additional fields, or add a parent control).
Once there are two or more options in the control, a user can select the field they want represented in the table or visualization and dynamically toggle among the options.
Parent controls
These controls will allow you to coordinate the toggling of multiple controls at once from a single point and click UI. From any existing control, select the option Add parent control. A control will appear above the table, select the three dot menu to edit the control. First add options that will appear in the drop down, then assign the child controls that will be chosen based on the option selected in the parent control.
NOTE
Controls created in the workbook will not appear on the dashboard. Read more about how to add controls on the dashboard level here.
