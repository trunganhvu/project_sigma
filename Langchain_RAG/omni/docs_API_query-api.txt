Query APIs
THESE APIS ARE IN BETA
Query APIs are in beta and may have future breaking changes.
The query APIs allow you to interact with workbook queries in Omni.
Run a query
Runs the query specified in the request body. Successful requests will return the data as a base64 encoded Apache Arrow table, allowing you to extract query results from Omni and use them elsewhere. For example, piping data to Google Sheets or leveraging data in a Python notebook.

Parameters
Name Type Required Description
query Object âœ“ A JSON object representing the query to be run.
userId String (UUID) Optional UUID to run the query as a specific user. If not provided, uses the user associated with the API token. The userId must belong to a user in your organization.
DID YOU KNOW?
You can retrieve a query's JSON object right from an Omni workbook:
Open a workbook in Omni.
Toggle open the Inspector panel. For Mac use Option + 9; for Windows, use Alt + 9.
Locate the Query structure section.
Copy the query JSON.
Returns
Successful responses will contain the following:
An object with a jobs_submitted property
An object containing details about the job, such as job_id, status, and the provided query
The job details object will also contain a result property, which contains the query results as a base64 encoded Apache Arrow table. At this point, you can use something like Omni Python SDK to decode and validate the results.

ENCOUNTERING TIMEOUTS?
If a request takes too long, the response will include a remaining_job_ids property. When this occurs, poll the GET /api/unstable/query/wait endpoint until the timeout property is false:
curl https://myorg.omniapp.co/api/unstable/query/wait?job_ids=[remaining_job_ids]
