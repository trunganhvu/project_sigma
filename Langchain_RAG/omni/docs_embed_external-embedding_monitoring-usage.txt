Monitoring usage
There are two areas in Admin > Settings that will show data about your embed instance.
Embed this is where you will set up your urls, but also where you can view ongoing and expired embed sessions. Note that expired and deleted sessions will mean the embed url used to create the session will no longer display content.
To manually delete a session, click on the options button (i.e. the vertical three dots button) to the right of the session to open the options menu. Then press “Delete Session”.
You can also filter sessions based on user name. Simply type a search string in the input above the sessions table.
Users this is where embed users information is found. It shows:
User name
Created date/time
Email
It is also how you can impersonate the user to test how that user will see the content. Click on Manage and then the three dots on the left will show the Impersonate User option.
