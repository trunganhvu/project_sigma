Create an Omni Redshift user
Create Omni user in Redshift
CREATE USER omni WITH PASSWORD 'some_password_here';
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA 'your_schema_here' TO omni;
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE information_schema.tables TO omni;
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE information_schema.columns TO omni;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA 'your_schema_here' TO omni;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA 'your_other_schema_here' TO omni;
Create a connection in Omni
Name: <CONNECTION_NAME>
Dialect: Redshift
Host: <YOUR_ACCOUNT>
Port: 5439
Database: <YOUR_DATABASE>
Default Schema <YOUR_SCHEMA>
User: omni (if you created a user above)
Password: <YOUR_PASSWORD>
Other Notes
If you are using Redshift views via dbt, Omni may not be granted permissions if there are dependencies with other schemas. To open up those views, simply grant SELECT access to those views as well. If objects are declared as tables, they will be available in Omni.
