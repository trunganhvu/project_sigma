Integrate git for model version control
Omniâ€™s git integration allows you to sync an Omni model to a git repository (GitHub, GitLab, and Azure DevOps Server are currently supported). This is done on the model level.
Using a git integration provides added development benefits of storing backups of model files and using pull requests to create collaborative and peer reviewed changes. Additionally, it's possible to require pull requests, for those that want a more structured development lifecycle.
Enabling the git integration requires the use of Branch Mode for modifications to the Shared model, ensuring a structured and organized development process.
Limitations
A git repository and base branch can be linked to one model at a time.
Editing model files directly within external platforms is not yet supported.
Supported git providers
Omni's git integration currently supports the following git providers:
GitHub
GitLab
Microsoft Azure DevOps
Refer to the git integration setup guide to get started.
Configuration
After a git repository is connected to a model, Organization Admins can configure the integration's behavior by navigating to Model > Git Settings in the model IDE.
For example, pull requests aren't required by default. This can be changed using the integration's settings. Refer to the git integration settings reference for more information.
