Model generation
Models are automatically generated after a connection is added. For each model, you will see a schema model and an extension model. Omni divides the model into two core layers to allow for better workflow - the Schema model that stays in sync with raw database tables and views and the model extension, where user-defined, virtualized data models live in Omni (think fields, joins, and additional metadata (formats, descriptions, etc).
Schema Model
The schema model is intended to serve as a baseline version of the database schema, for simple point and click query, and some inferred key relationships. The schema model is not editable to users (more below in model extension). To refresh the schema to bring to live, simple hit the 'refresh schema' inside the given schema model:
Note that even when deleting / ignoring schema fields, they will still be available from direct SQL to users with permission to query open SQL.
Model Extension
The model extension is the core user-curated data model in Omni. Paired with the schema model, it forms the basis of pivot table experience in workbooks. Fields, joins, and other metadata extend / supplement the schema model. To "delete" raw schema fields from the model, simply ignore them in the model extension more here.
In addition to entirely new fields and relationships, schema fields can be extended with new metadata - formatting, labels, or 'deleting' (via ignored:true).
To see both schema model and the model extension together, simply toggle 'Combined Model'. Note edits can be made in the combined model and will be tucked into the model extension, for example ignoring 'deleted' schema fields.
