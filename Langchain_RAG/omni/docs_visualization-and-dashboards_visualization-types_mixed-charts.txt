Mixed Charts (Bar + Line)
While not a specific chart type, mixed charts can be common for displaying different data series together, or for charts like Pareto.
Bar + Line
Pareto Chart: This is done by simply adding a % of total, and then a running total over the % of total.
Configuration
See bar, line, scatter, and area docs.
The overall mark selector at the top of the configuration sets the global chart configuration (configuration across all series). Note that each series can be set independently to bar, line, scatter, area independently under their y-axis controls. To build a mixed chart, either select the bar/line accelerator, or set a base chart type and adjust the other series using the icon on the y-axis:
