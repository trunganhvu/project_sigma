Data security best practices
For internal embedding the content will only be visible to logged-in members of your Omni organization that have access to the underlying content. If they are not already logged in, they will be prompted to authenticate through the iFrame.
For both internal and external embedding the best practice for protecting data is to leverage user attributes to systematically filter the data.
Omni connection base roles
We recommend that you set connection base roles to either No Access or Viewer by default.
Multi-tenant customer data
Typically, companies choose one of the following strategies to set up multi-tenant customer data:
Row level security - If all of the data is inside one table, you can assign a user attribute per user and client and use it as an access filter. Specifically make sure to set up a default access filter to control in Omni with default_topic_access_filters:.
Schema level security - If each client is in a separate, identical schemas then you can leverage dynamic schemas.
HIDDEN FILTERS & SECURITY
Segmenting data using hidden dashboard filters is not a secure practice.
Embedded dashboards
Embedded dashboards won't render correctly if the content you want to embed meets any of the following criteria:
Content contains fields not modeled in a topic
Content built on SQL
Content saved in your personal folder (the content must be in the Shared hub)
Content that contains changes to the workbook model's joins which have not been merged or promoted
WARNING
In the event that you want to expose SQL-based or non-topic bound content to your embed users, you can accomplish this by enabling the AccessBoost role in the content's Share settings.
This has security implications, as you may expose data to your embed users that you don't want them to see.
