Email deliveries
With email deliveries, you can automatically schedule sending dashboards and individual tiles to your team.
Setup
No prior set up is required to use emails as a delivery destination. To create an email delivery, refer to the Creating deliveries guide for instructions.
Whitelabeling with custom sender options
THIS FEATURE IS IN BETA
The Custom email sender feature is currently in beta. To have this feature enabled, reach out to Omni support: support@omni.co.
By default, delivery emails are sent from an Omni email address. Omni's Custom email sender feature allows you to customize delivery emails' sender information, such as the sender's name and reply-to email address. This is especially useful for instances where you need to whitelabel Omni emails, such as using Omni as an embedded product.
After Omni support enables this feature, an Omni Organization Admin will need to:
Open the Settings page.
Click Deliveries > Email tab.
Toggle Custom email sender to On.
Fill in the Sender Name and Sender Email fields.
When finished, you can send a test (Send test) or Save changes.
Recipients
Recipients can be other members of your Omni organization or non-users, such as a contractor or external stakeholder. When recipients without an Omni account are added to a delivery, Omni creates a shell account, or an email-only user.
Email-only users
An email-only user is a recipient of a delivery that isn't associated with an Omni account. Omni builds these accounts to allow you to monitor scheduler usage and other related metadata.
Like users with Omni accounts, email-only users can also be assigned user attributes for dynamic content.
Organization Admins can view all email-only users by navigating to Settings > Users > Email-only tab. Note: This tab will only display if there is at least one email-only user receiving a delivery.
