Create Postgres User
Create Omni user
CREATE USER omni WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'some_password_here';
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE database_name to omni;
\c database_name
GRANT SELECT ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO omni;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO omni;
If you are using a schema other than public grant usage to Omni:
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA schema_name TO omni
Make sure future tables will be accessible:
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT ON tables TO omni;
ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES IN SCHEMA public GRANT SELECT ON sequences TO omni;
