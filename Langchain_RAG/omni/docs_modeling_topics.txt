Topics
In Omni, a Topic is a curated dataset that organizes and structures data around a specific area of interest or analysis.
Topics can help you improve:
Self-service. Creating refined subsets of data means users can query and explore without needing to understand the entire data model.
Reusability. Once defined, topics can be re-used in any analysis that utilizes the model containing the topic.
Consistency. Topics ensure that analyses across different users or teams are built using the same data definitions and logic.
What's a topic?
Topics are defined within models and linked to a specific database connection. They specify a primary base table along with any associated tables that can be joined for analysis.
Creating topics
Topics can be created in a few ways:
In the workbook
In the IDE

Defining topic settings
Every topic has an associated topic file, where you can define various settings to apply to the topic. For example, data access control, cache policies, default filters, and so on. Refer to the Topic file parameters reference for more information about these settings.
Using topics in analyses
To use a topic in an analysis, use the topic switcher in the workbook's Fields & topics panel. A list of tables included in the topic will populate the panel, which you can then use in your analysis.
Adding tables to topics using joins
By default, when you create a topic, Omni adds all joinable non-fanout tables to the topic â€” specifically those with many-to-one or one-to-one relationships to other tables. The list of joinable tables can also be curated, either to remove joins generated by default or to force in tables that would fan out the base table, such as many-to-many or one-to-many joins.
Joins added to the model's relationships file can also be added to topics.
Adding joins can be done a few ways:
In the workbook
In the IDE








Refer to the Relationships & Joins documentation for more information.
WARNING
When joins are deleted or modified to become invalid, they must be manually removed from a topic.
