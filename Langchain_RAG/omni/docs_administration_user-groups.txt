User groups
User groups allow you to assign connection or content permission roles to a group of users in bulk. This feature streamlines the role assignment process and management across connections, document folders, or individual documents.
Updating a group's connection permission set can be done within the groups section on the connection permissions page. Similarly, when on a document or folder, users can add the group name to the content permissions dialog to assign permissions at the group level.
Users can also be added to groups via SCIM integrations and API.
A user's group membership can also be leveraged for permissioning via the omni_user_groups user attribute, returning a comma separated list of groups that they belong in.
