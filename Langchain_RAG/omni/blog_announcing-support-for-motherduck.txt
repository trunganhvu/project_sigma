We don't think you should have to compromise when it comes to your data. This is why we empower data analysts with the speed of SQL and the governance of a data model...so you can fuel your organization's operations with faster, trusted insights. This is also why we know we can't compromise either - we need to work with the latest and greatest - and today I'm (ducking) thrilled to announce our support for MotherDuck 🎉
From years of experience, we know that helping people use data better doesn’t just start at the BI layer. We need to think about the whole data stack and build robust connections to make data accessible and understandable - to everyone. To do this, we first launched Omni with support for leading cloud data warehouses like Snowflake, Redshift, and BigQuery, as well as databases like MySQL and Postgres.
And just as MPP databases shifted the way data was used and accessed, we need to constantly look forward to the latest and greatest in database evolution - helping customers leverage new technologies.
This journey keeps us exploring exciting new paths to support and partner with emerging technologies shaping the future of our industry, enter: MotherDuck.
We’ve admired DuckDB from the start. Its state-of-the-art columnar-vectorized query execution engine and seamless integration with Apache Arrow have driven impressive performance as our re-queryable cache.
MotherDuck takes DuckDB's speed and ease of use a step further by facilitating a multi-player, hosted cloud experience. Their innovative hybrid execution model enables customers to scale effortlessly from their laptop to the cloud, fostering a seamless blend of flexibility and collaboration that pushes the boundaries of modern data analytics.
We’re excited to combine the flexibility of MotherDuck’s seamless managed cloud data warehouse with Omni’s new BI experience. Make your data truly ubiquitous.
