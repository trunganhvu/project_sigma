Net New Model and Modeling in the Workbook
The centralized data model is one of Omniâ€™s core principles and allows data teams to maintain governance over their business logic. However, what makes Omni unique is that it allows for business users to define their own logic and contribute to the centralized data model while still maintaining the single source of truth. In this section, we will cover getting started with the data model both using the UI and from within the IDE itself.
Net New Model
In this tutorial, we walk through setting up an initial data model in Omni after establishing a connection. Omni simplifies the process by automatically building the model, which can then be enhanced through a click-based UI or directly in the IDE. We'll start by creating a topic, a curated data set that makes it easier for users to navigate relevant information, reducing overwhelm while enabling deep self-service.
Key features include the ability to enforce row-level and column-level security, hide fields, and automate the discovery of joins between tables based on column names. Omni intelligently identifies join opportunities, and users can further refine these joins through the UI by selecting join keys and types (e.g., left, inner, outer joins) or leveraging the infer relationship feature for unknown cardinality. These interactive UI components generate code behind the scenes, streamlining model creation and allowing even non-technical users to explore data without deep database knowledge. We'll also dive into the modeling layer in future sessions to explore direct code editing.
Creating New Fields (Quick aggregates, Add Field, Excel Promotion)
In this tutorial, we explore three powerful ways to create new fields within Omni's workbook interface, designed to simplify data manipulation for users at all skill levels.
Quick Aggregates: Instantly generate sums, averages, and other aggregations by right-clicking on a field, making complex calculations accessible without coding.
Custom SQL Fields: Use the "Add Field" feature to write custom SQL definitions, such as concatenating user names, and leverage Omni's own field syntax for flexibility and consistency across the model. This allows for easy changes and propagations across the dataset.
In-Workbook Calculations: Create Excel-like calculations directly in the workbook by combining columns. These calculations can be promoted for repeated use, making them accessible across multiple areas in Omni for non-technical users.
We'll also explore the underlying code generated by these actions and cover advanced model curation techniques to ensure best practices when building out topics within Omni.
