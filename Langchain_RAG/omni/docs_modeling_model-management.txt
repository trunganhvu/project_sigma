Model Management
Managing your models in Omni can be done through the workbook layer or the development IDE. This is made possible by Omni's layered approach to maintaining your data and allowing users to promote those changes to the different layers, i.e. model layer and workbook layer. We also offer a dbt integration that allows you to access that layer as well.
Users can model and query in the workbook model layer and leave all the content they create isolated to that workbook. If users want to make the changes in that workbook reusable and accessible to other users, the changes need to be promoted to the Shared Model. This action pushes the workbook model changes to the model layer and new workbooks will include the changes that were pushed.
Shared Model Promotion
Shared model promotion is an important facet of model editing within the workbook model layer. Shared model promotion pushes changes made in the workbook layer into the model layer so the changes are reusable and available in all workbooks. Model promotion can be done a number of ways depending on your workflow preferences:
Promote all changes
Promote all of your collective changes into the Shared Model any time from the workbook Model menu option, Promote to Shared.
Incrementally promote workbook changes
Incrementally promote changes to the Shared Model by clicking on the branch icon to the left of the workbook. This is a handy feature for changes that are not quite ready to go live to the masses yet.
Note this option only works while making changes using Branch Mode. Learn more about Branch Mode.
Editing in the IDE
Edits made directly in the develop model IDE will be "Promoted to the Shared Model" as soon as the file is saved. For more structured development processes, explore the branch mode and git integration options.
Branch Mode
Branch mode allows users to view the impact of model and/or workbook changes before they are promoted to the Shared Model for other users to view. It is possible to make changes in a single workbook or collect a series of changes across different workbooks that are all based on the same model connection. Users can also enter branch mode directly in the model's IDE to make model changes and see those changes across associated workbooks and dashboards.

Content Validator
The Content Validator allows users to visualize broken content when the model or downstream database references inevitably change.
Access the model validator from the left-hand navigation in the model IDE. You can update content in bulk when those downstream dependencies change. Another bonus use case is you can use the validator to find all content that uses a certain field, view, or topic to understand how much something is being used before you update or remove it.
Updates can be pushed through across views (swapping the reference table), fields (swapping field references), or topics (moving queries between topics). Updates can be pushed through one-by-one, or in bulk across all content.
Model Editing
Edit a Model in the Workbook Layer(Easy Mode)
The workbook allows users to not only explore data but it also allows users to create new model content like topics, relationships (joins), new fields, SQL views and fields, as well as promote those all from the workbook model layer back into the model layer.
Create a Topic
Topics curate the views that are joined together for exploring (querying) data in the workbook view.
Starting from your Omni app's homepage, click on the ** + New ** button in the top left corner of your Omni app's homepage.
Select the database connection you want to use. Now we have two options:
Create a new topic
Edit an existing topic
Create a new topic
At the bottom of the list of Topics, click on the All Views * Fields option in the Advanced section. This will show you the views and the fields in those views available in the model connection you chose.
Topic with a single view
In the view's menu, click on the Modeling option then choose Make Topic.
The topic is now available in this workbook model.
To promote this topic to the Shared Model, choose from an option outlined here. #ADD A LINK#
Topic with multiple views (Joins)
Hover over the view name that you want to set as the base view and click on the vertical three-dot icon that appears.
Click on the Set as Base View option. This hides the other views field picker menu.
After opening the view's menu and clicking on Joins there are two options: a. Omni makes a suggested join, it's the option with the links icon to the left of the suggested view name.
Clicking on this option still opens up the Join modal but all of the join options are pre-populated based on inferred knowledge of the fields in the two views.
(Optional) Edit the choices in the parameter options.
Click Update. b. Clicking on + New Join opens up the Join modal. Walk through the field inputs in the pop-up modal to create a new join. Repeat this process for adding multiple joins back to the base view. This method is only recommended for joins requiring one join condition in the ON clause.
Choose the view to join from the Choose right view drop-down.
Click on the fields you want to join on. Recommend choosing a field like a unique ID.
The default join type is a Left join but other join types like inner, full outer and cross joins are also available.
In the Relationship (Advanced) field can you can click on the Infer Relationship button in the bottom left of the modal. This will populate the assumed relationship into this field. Alternatively, if you know your join relationship choose one of the options from the drop-down.
We recommend only adding joins to your current topic. Use the Add to all possible topics option with caution as this may expose data in workbooks that should not be seen by certain users.
Edit a Model in the IDE (Hard Mode)
Create Your First Topic
Find your model
Define relationships
Create your topic
Navigate to your Omni app's homepage.
Click on the ** + New ** button in the top right of your Omni app's homepage.
Quick tips
Joins
Topics
Workbook
Omni automatically adds joinable tables by default when you set up your connection.
Users can curate the list of joinable tables to add or remove specific tables.
New joins can be added to topics using the relationships file or custom joins per-topic basis.
Model History
Model history in the developer IDE allows users to see the changes made to the model and restore to an older version.
Explore & Compare Older Versions
The left-hand menu includes a chronological list of time-stamped changes. The detailed view to the right of the list of changes, compares the previous change to the currently selected version.
Restore an Older Version
Restore a previously saved version of your model files by navigating to the change you want to restore to.
Click Preview restore
Compare the changes in all affected files.
Select Restore this version.
Refresh Schema
Omni strives to stay in lockstep with changes in the database layer below. One of the more challengeing experiences in BI management are when schema changes occur in the database layer, and this has only become more prevelant with dbt.
The shared data model exists in two layers, the schema model from the database and the user-generated, virtual fields that exist only in the Omni layer. When Refresh Schema is selected from Model dropdown in the IDE, simple field references will be updated to reflect the current schema in the database (including objects like dbt views). This means if columns or tables are added or removed, these changed would be reflected in the updated schema model. Note these changes may result in invalid/broken references, but will be flagged by the model validator.
Schema refresh may be user-triggered, or automated on a schedule.
Note that the schema refresh kicks off a job that runs in the background, so can take several minutes depending on size of database. If schema updates do not appear instantly, give the refresh job a bit of time to complete.
Refresh Your Schema
You can refresh your schema(s) connected to Omni by selecting "Refresh Schema" from the Model dropdown in your model's IDE.
WARNING
The updates (if any) made by refreshing your schema may result in invalid/broken references, but will be flagged by the model validator.
Refreshing the schema updates field references to reflect current database schema changes, though this process is currently manual and may take several minutes to complete (depends on the size of your schema in the database). Automated scheduling for schema refreshes is planned for future implementation.
Refresh Schema with dbt
Refreshing to schema while connnected to dbt will mostly work the same as schema refreshes in isolation. The current differences include:
Omni will search your schema for views that correspond to dbt models and add dbt metadata to them
Omni will optionally generate primary key definitions and relationships based on constraints
Export to dbt
We want to make model management easy both in Omni and below the BI layer. To this end, we offer the ability to export a view file's dbt SQL. This will allow users to build fact tables, or virtualized fields into their dbt models beneath Omni.
Currently this will require some rework of your Omni model, because new dbt views will then be populated into the model upon schema refresh. This means field references would need to be remapped to maintain continuity. In the future the intent is for this promotion to become button-click.
