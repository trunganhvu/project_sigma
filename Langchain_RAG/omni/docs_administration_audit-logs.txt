Audit logs
Audit logs are detailed records of the activity your users are taking in Omni, which can be useful for security and performance analysis. Events included in logs are structured as JSON payloads and sent in batches to Amazon S3 a few minutes after they're written.
Setup
Contact Omni support to request and set up this feature.
Once configured, Instance Admin permissions are required to access audit logs.
Data retention
By default, logs are retained for at least one year. Contact Omni support if you need a shorter retention period.
