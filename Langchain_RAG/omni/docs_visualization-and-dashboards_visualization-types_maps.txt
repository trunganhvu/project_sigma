Map Visualizations
Omni currently supports point and region map types.
Point Maps
Data with latitude-longitude pairs can be visualized as a point map. Points can be sized and colored by additional properties in the dataset.
Popular Examples
Map with Color Pins
Map with Sized Pins:
Region Maps
Data with region-based location information can be visualized as a region map. Omni offers region-based mappings for countries and US states out of the box, and offers a custom region option for greater flexibility.
Built-in Countries
Country region data can be mapped against your dataset by either country name, 2-digit country code or 3-digit country code.
Dataset Map
Built-in US States
US state region data can be mapped against your dataset by either name or 2-digit code.
Dataset Map
Custom Regions
Omni allows you to specify your own region data via URL. You can specify an endpoint that returns region data complying to either the GeoJSON or TileJSON specifications.
In order to use custom regions, you'll need to set your region type to "Custom" and then fill out the following fields:
Source type - specify whether your region source is GeoJSON or TileJSON
Source URL - the URL from which to load your GeoJSON or TileJSON data
Source layer (TileJSON only) - the layer within the TileJSON specification you want to map against
Region property - the property in the GeoJSON or TileJSON data that you want to map against
Dataset Map
Projection types
Point and region maps support 2D (mercator) and 3D (globe) projections.
2D (Mercator) 3D (Globe)
Custom Visualizations
More complex map visualizations can be unlocked using advanced visualization, including:
static lat-long
zipcode maps
other chloropleths (depending on the static map), or multi-layer maps (like points + regions).
