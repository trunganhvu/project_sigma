Webhooks
If you want to customize your Omni deliveries, webhooks may be a good fit. While you can specify some things - like the email sender for email deliveries or the channel message for Slack deliveries - webhooks give you the ability to create context-specific workflows.
For example, you could use a platform like Zapier to catch Omni webhooks and:
Perform different actions based on data values, such as those for CSV-formatted deliveries
Schedule data exports to Google Sheets
Requirements
To successfully use Omni webhook deliveries, your webhook must return an HTTP 200 status response upon delivery. A different status could cause delivery retries or failures.
Setup
Prior to using webhooks as a delivery destination, you'll need to create a webhook URL for Omni to send requests to. Refer to the Guides section for app-specific walkthroughs.
To create a webhook delivery in Omni, refer to the Creating deliveries guide for instructions.
Request formats
The type of delivery Omni sends determines the format the request body will take:
Link-only
Omni will send a POST request with a JSON object in the body that contains:
{
  "url": "<dashboard_url>"
}
Text-based Formats (CSV, JSON)
Omni will send a POST request with the content directly in the body and appropriate Content-Type headers:
CSV: Content-Type: text/csv
JSON: Content-Type: application/json
Note: For dashboard deliveries with multiple queries, CSV content will be delivered as a ZIP file using the binary format below.
Binary Formats (XLSX, PDF, PNG, ZIP)
Omni will send a POST request using FormData with the file content. The request will include:
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
File data with appropriate MIME type for each format
