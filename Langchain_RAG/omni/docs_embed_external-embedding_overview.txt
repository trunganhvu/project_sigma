External embedding
External embedding enables delivering data to users outside of the business, living in other applications. Reporting can be mapped to row level permissions, allowing many users to access identical reports filtered to only their own data.
Using embedded Omni content, you could create:
Simple, interactive dashboards for high-level summaries
Ephemeral workbooks to give their users deeper access to their data
More robust data applications
All these use cases leverage the same base technology: creating an authorized Omni URL that you'll use in an iframe. The URL contains the content you want to share, the ID of the user in your system, and the attributes you want that user to have. You'll then sign the URL with a secret key provided by Omni.
