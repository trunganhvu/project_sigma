Managing users with Google Workspace SAML
Omni can be integrated with Google Workspace for user authentication via the SAML protocol. Google Workspace cannot currently be used to provision users and groups using Omni's SCIM APIs.
To setup SAML with Google Workspace, follow these steps:
In your Google Workspace Admin console, create a new app for Omni
In the navigation bar, select Apps > Web and mobile apps
Click the "Add app" dropdown from above the table, and select "Add custom SAML app"
Name the app "Omni Analytics" or your preferred name, optionally add a description and logo, and press Continue
Note the SSO URL, Entity ID, and Certificate to enter into Omni in a later step
Set the ACS URL to the value of the Single sign-on URL from the Omni Authentication settings page
Set the Entity ID to the full hostname of your Omni instance - e.g. myorg.omniapp.co. Do NOT include https:// in the Entity ID.
Leave Start URL blank and Signed response unchecked
Set the Name ID Format to EMAIL and Name ID to "Basic Information > Primary email"
press Continue
In the attributes section, add mappings from "First name" to "first_name" and "Last name" to "last_name"
Press finish
Configure Omni authentication settings
Enter the Sign on URL, Issuer, and Signing Certificate you noted from Google Workspace above
Check the box to enable the SAML connection
Save the SAML configuration
Assign users and groups to the Omni application in Google Workspace
In the User Access section of the app configuration, ensure that the appropriate users have access to the app
Once these steps are complete, you will see the option to Login with SAML on your Login page.
