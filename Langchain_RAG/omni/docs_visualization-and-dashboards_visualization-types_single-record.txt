Single record tables
Single record visualization offer a compact way to show a single row of data, pivoted to display the full row in a single column. If more than one row is present, the visualization will only show the top row. Note: Full table transpose is available in the table visualization options.
Configuration
The only configuration for single record offers a bit of layout control:
Horizontal: A slightly more compact version of the single-row table
Vertical: Field names above their associated value
Compact: The default view (see above)
