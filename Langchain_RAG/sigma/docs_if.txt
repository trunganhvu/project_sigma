If
Suggest Edits
The If function returns Value 1 for every row where the first condition is met. If more than one condition is supplied, the second condition is evaluated and returns Value 2 for every row where the second condition is met. If all conditions are False, then the Else value is applied for every row that does not belong to the preceding conditions.
Syntax
If(condition 1, value 1, [condition 2], [value 2],..., [else])
Function arguments: 
condition 1 (required) Logical condition that returns a result that is either True or False.
value 1 (required) The value to be returned if its preceding condition is True.
condition 2+, value 2+ (optional) Several If/Then pairs can be listed in a single function. Every supplied condition must have a corresponding value.
else (optional) The value to be returned if no conditionals evaluate to True. 
📘
If an Else argument is not specified, a Null result is returned by default when no conditions are met.

You can use operators in conditions.
