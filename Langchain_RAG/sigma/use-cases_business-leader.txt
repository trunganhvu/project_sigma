Business leaders need tools that help solve complex business problems and boost their team’s productivity but they are often hindered by complicated processes, inaccurate data, and require analysts to provide simple answers.

Sigma enables all users to freely explore and answer their own questions—all from within a secure, familiar user interface. Instead of moving data from all your business apps, Sigma connects directly to your data warehouse for accurate, governed data.
Improve your performance, scale, and efficiency
One of the top reasons your team might not use data to make more informed business decisions is slow reports and dashboards. Sigma solves that problem with real-time insights on billions of rows of data and lightning-fast performance.

Concerned that higher adoption and better performance is going to increase compute costs in your data warehouse? Not with Sigma’s Alpha Query. Sigma is intelligent enough to determine when it can use data in the browser cache to perform new calculations vs. the need for new queries. As a result, your business benefits from more efficient use of data, higher user adoption, and better performance. It’s a win-win-win.
Better self-service and ad-hoc analysis on secure, real-time data
All too often businesses get by with “good enough” decisions that end up costing $$$ in the long run. The best-performing companies in the world use data to their advantage for better, faster business decisions. Sigma provides a familiar, spreadsheet-like user interface that can be utilized by even the most non-technical business users. Instead of trying to teach yet another technology that over-promises and under-delivers, we meet users where they are today.
Solve the incomplete data problem
You’ve probably heard the famous quote “data without context is useless.” Analytics can explain “what” happened, but often require human knowledge to explain “why” it happened. Sigma solves this problem with built-in collaboration, annotations on data, and input tables. With Input Tables, your team can effortlessly incorporate human context into their analysis by creating and entering data into tables like you would in a traditional spreadsheet. That data is entered as system tables directly in your cloud data warehouse, bringing a single source of truth to your data ecosystem.
“We wanted a tool that everybody could use and understand. Sigma makes it easier for product managers and other business stakeholders to explore and navigate data.”
Will Clayton, Head of Data Analytics, Customer.io
