Securely write back data
directly to the cloud
BREAK THROUGH THE DATA-TO-WAREHOUSE BARRIER WITH INPUT TABLES
FROM STARTUPS TO THE FORTUNE 500, SIGMA SCALES WITH TEAMS OF ALL SIZES
Input Tables empower your team to write new data back to your cloud data platform alongside the original dataset.
DO MORE WITH DATA
Unlock new capabilities to build data apps
Go beyond data analysis and build applications off your warehouse data. Input Tables power forms and multi-user workflows that teams use  to replace other 3rd party applications.
IMPROVED DECISION-MAKING
Plan for any scenario
Most BI tools are limited to simply showing you the data. In Sigma, you can input new data to see how it impacts projected outcomes.
REAL-TIME DATA MANAGEMENT
Add, edit, and manage fresh data directly in Sigma
Create and enter data into tables like you would in a traditional spreadsheet, which are stored as new tables directly in your warehouse.
ENHANCED COLLABORATION
Power collaborative workflows
Add important context to your  analysis right alongside the warehouse data. Plus, use live edit to collaborate on the analysis with other colleagues in real-time.
SECURITY AND COMPLIANCE
Ensure strong security and governance
Sigma enhances security with controlled access, audit trails, and compliance, ensuring data integrity and traceability.
SCALABILITY
Scale with your needs
Spreadsheets don’t scale to billions of records—Sigma lets you write back large data seamlessly with updates and collaboration.
Enhance your product with write-back
