Register a Plugin with your Sigma Organization
Suggest Edits
Sigma supports plugin elements in workbooks. Plugins are third-party applications built to add additional functionality into an existing product. For example, a software developer in your organization may create a plugin that allows you to display your data in a chart type not otherwise supported in Sigma. 
Organization members only have access to plugins registered with their organization.
Requirements
To register a plugin, you must have either an Admin account type or a custom account type that supports plugin developer feature permissions.
The plugin should be hosted; you need to provide a production URL.
