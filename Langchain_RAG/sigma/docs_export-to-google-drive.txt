Export to Google Drive
Suggest Edits
You can send individual workbook elements, workbook pages, or an entire workbook to Google Drive on a set schedule or an as-needed basis. Depending on what you send to Google Drive, you can export data in different file formats. For details on supported file formats, see Send or schedule workbook exports.
To export directly to Google Sheets, see Export to Google Sheets.
Sigma generates exports from the workbook's latest published version. Draft changes are not exported.
User requirements
The ability to export to Google Drive requires the following:
You must be assigned an account type with the Export to Google Drive permission enabled.
You must be the workbook owner or be granted Can explore or Can edit workbook permission.
You must be a Manager, Content manager, or Contributor of the specified Google Drive folder.
Google account authorization
The first time you schedule an export to Google Sheets or Google Drive, Sigma prompts you to authorize Sigma to export to your Google account:
Click Authorize and follow the instructions on your screen. After you complete the authorization, you return to the Schedule Exports dialog.
Schedule an export to Google Drive
To schedule an export to Google Drive:
From the workbook menu (), select Schedule exports....
If this is the first schedule for the workbook, click Add Schedule, otherwise click + New schedule.
Select Google Drive.
If this is the first time you've created a scheduled export to Google, Sigma prompts you to enable the integration. See Google account authorization.
For Drive folder, enter a name for a new folder to contain the export. You cannot use an existing folder. Every export creates a Google Sheet in the destination folder with a name that matches the following structure:
<Workbook Name>_<Element Name>_<Timestamp>.
Click Create Folder.
Sigma creates the folder for you and displays the URL to the folder.
For Attachments, select the data and file formats that you want to export.
In the Frequency section, set the delivery schedule:
(Optional) Select the dropdown for Daily and select Weekly, Monthly, or Custom.
For Daily, select Once a day or Multiple times.
For Weekly, select which days of the week to send an email, and choose between Once a day or Multiple times.
For Monthly, select which day of the month to send an email, and the time of day.
For Custom, specify a schedule using cron syntax. See Set up a custom delivery schedule.
If you select Multiple times, specify the frequency. For example, every 2 hours on the :15 of the hour between 9 AM and 6 PM.
ðŸ“˜
If you don't have the option to set a specific frequency, export frequency might be restricted for your organization. For more details, see Restrict export recipients and frequency.
(Optional) Adjust the default schedule time zone using the dropdown menu.
(Optional) Choose how often to send the export: Always or only If a condition is met. See Schedule a conditional export or alert.
(Optional) If you choose to send an export only If a condition is met, you can turn on the switch to stop notifying after a set number of occurrences per day, week, or in total. (This feature is in beta and subject to the Beta features notice).
(Optional) Select the checkbox for Customize control values to filter the exported data according to the value of one or more workbook controls. See Configure additional options for exports.
