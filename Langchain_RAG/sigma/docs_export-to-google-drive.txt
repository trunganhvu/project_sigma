Export to Google Drive
Suggest Edits
You can send individual workbook elements, workbook pages, or an entire workbook to Google Drive on a set schedule or an as-needed basis. Depending on what you send to Google Drive, you can export data in different file formats. For details on supported file formats, see Send or schedule workbook exports.
