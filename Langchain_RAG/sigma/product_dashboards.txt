Dashboards that work the way you’ve always wanted
DON’T CHOOSE BETWEEN SPEED-TO-INSIGHT AND SCALABILITY. SIGMA DASHBOARDS GET YOU BOTH.
TOP TEAMS CHOOSE SIGMA. SEE FOR YOURSELF.
Stop the extracts. Stop the delays. Stop the endless data loops.
Sigma simplifies the process of requesting, validating, and exploring data for both dashboard builders and consumers.
SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
No more duplicated dashboards
Users enter the Explore mode to perform an ad hoc analysis, which allows them to customize dashboard content without changing the master version.
LINEAGE
Every element acts as a data source
As you build elements from an original data source, you can re-use those elements as new data sources, effectively carrying over your data logic to downstream elements.
REAL-TIME
Data you can trust from live cloud query
Make confident decisions with data you know is always up-to-date, via Sigma’s direct connection to your cloud data platform.

GOVERNED
Views and access customized by role
Set controls over who can see what in the dashboard, so that only authorized users can access sensitive or secure data.
PLUG & PLAY
Easy to build
Simply choose a data source and get building. Users can drag and drop charts, tables, text and imagery into a grid-style workbook, and even trigger dashboard actions based on clicks.
CUSTOMIZE
Beautiful by default
Use container elements, custom styling, and a library of data visualizations to tell a story with your data. Plus, set custom themes that reflect the company brand.
Say goodbye to the dashboard dilemma
Downloading data because you can’t wait on another team to update the dashboard? You’re not alone. Luckily, Sigma breaks this cycle.
