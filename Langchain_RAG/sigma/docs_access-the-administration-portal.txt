Suggest Edits
If you are a Sigma admin, you can configure and customize your Sigma organization in the Administration portal.
To access the Administration portal:
Go to Home and select the user icon with your initials.
Select Administration.
Requirements
Users assigned the Admin account type can access and edit all configurations in the Administration portal.
Other users might have access to specific sections of the Administration portal, depending on the permissions enabled on their assigned account type:
Permissions in the Usage dashboard section grant access to usage dashboards in the Usage page.
Manage all branding settings grants access to manage all branding settings, including setting up a custom SMTP server.
Manage all workbook themes and fonts grants access to specific branding functionality, such as setting up workbook themes.
Manage plugins grants access to manage plugins.
Common administration tasks
Onboard users and configure role-based access management and authentication methods:
Manage users and teams: Onboard new users by inviting new users and creating teams. Simplify management by setting up team admins.
Configure permissions and access: Customize account types and assign them to users. Configure the permissions enabled for each account type, and understand how account type permissions interact with document access and data permissions.
Set up authentication methods: Set up SAML or OAuth authentication methods, or centralize team and user management by configuring SCIM.
Set up third-party integrations with Sigma, and manage additional organization settings:
Integrate Sigma with third-party tools: Set up and manage integrations with OpenAI to use AI features, exports using Slack, and dbt to use dbt jobs, metadata, and Semantic Layer.
Configure Sigma functionality: Organization admins can exercise fine-grained control over some of the functionality that users can access. Disable or restrict functionality like public embeds, workbook comments, account upgrade requests, CSV uploads, and others.
Customize your Sigma organization to fit your branding and locale:
Customize and configure branding: Ensure your charts and workbooks align with your company branding. You can customize fonts and set up workbook themes with standardized color palettes. Customize the Sigma experience by adding a custom homepage and configuring email branding.
Localize organization settings: Provide users in your Sigma organization with content in their preferred language and locale, including timezone, currency, and date format. Set up a time zone for your account and set up a locale or translation files for your organization.
Monitor and audit user activity in Sigma:
Monitor Sigma usage: Understand how users in your organization use different Sigma features by reviewing different usage dashboards, such as scheduled exports, materialization, or document activity.
Audit activities in Sigma: If audit logging is enabled, review the audit logs for your organization.
Extend Sigma functionality:
Develop and test plugins: Enable developers in your organization to register plugins.
