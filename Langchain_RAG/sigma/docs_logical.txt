Logical
Suggest Edits
The Logical function converts the input value into a Boolean type, with a logical value of either True or False.
Usage
Logical(input)
input (required) The input that you would like to be interpreted as a logical operator. Input can be of text or number type.
When inputting text, “True” and “False” in any capitalization will be converted into the logical values True and False respectively. All other text will result in null.
When inputting a number, 0 is interpreted as False and all other numbers are interpreted as True.
📘
The Logical function can be used within other functions to ensure that an input is being read as a logical input.
