Window functions
Suggest Edits
Window functions perform operations across an entire table, table grouping (grouped rows), or defined window of rows. Sigma supports cumulative, moving, shifting, and ranking window functions.
Cumulative window functions
Cumulative window functions evaluate a specified column in a table or grouping and return the running total or cumulative value for all rows up to and including the current row. This differs from aggregate values that calculate a summary value for the entire table or grouping.
CumulativeAvg Calculates the running average up to and including the current row.
CumulativeCorr Calculates the correlation coefficient between dependent and independent data columns up to and including the current row.
CumulativeCount Counts the number of non-null values up to and including the current row.
CumeDist Calculates the cumulative distribution of values relative to the current row value.
CumulativeMax Returns the largest value up to and including the current row.
CumulativeMin Returns the smallest value up to and including the current row.
CumulativeStdDev Calculates the standard deviation of values up to and including the current row.
CumulativeSum Calculates the sum of values up to and including the current row.
CumulativeVariance Calculates the variance of a column up to and including the current row.
Moving window functions
Moving window functions evaluate a specified column and return a value based on a defined window of rows that moves in relation to the current row.
MovingAvg Calculates the numerical average of a column within a moving window.
MovingCorr Counts the number of non-Null values in a moving window.
MovingCount Calculates the correlation coefficient of two numerical columns within a moving window. See Pearson (bivariate) correlation coefficient.
MovingMax Finds the maximum value of a column within a moving window.
MovingMin Finds the minimum value of a column within a moving window.
MovingStdDev Calculates the standard deviation of a column within a moving window.
MovingSum Calculates the sum of a column in a moving window.
MovingVariance Calculates the statistical variance of a column in a moving window.
Shifting window functions
Shifting window functions evaluate a specified column in a table or grouping and return the value from a row that shifts in relation to the current row.
FillDown Replaces all null values in a column or grouping with the closest prior non-null value.
First Returns the first row value of a column or grouping.
FirstNonNull Returns the first non-null value from a column or grouping.
Lag Returns the value from a preceding offset row in a column or grouping.
Last Returns the last row value in a column or grouping.
LastNonNull Returns the last non-null value in a column or grouping.
Lead Returns the value from a subsequent offset row in a column or grouping.
Nth Returns the value from the nth row of a column or grouping.
Ranking window functions
Ranking window functions evaluate a specified column in a table or grouping and assign a rank to each row.
Ntile Assigns the specified rank, in order, to the column rows of a column, approximately equal number of rows for each rank.
Rank Assigns ranks to unique values in a column, from rank 1 onwards. Skips duplicate values.
RankDense Assigns ranks to all values in a column, from rank 1 onwards. Assigns the same rank to duplicate values.
RankPercentile Ranks the rows in the table by percentile.
RowNumber Numbers the table rows, starting with 1.
