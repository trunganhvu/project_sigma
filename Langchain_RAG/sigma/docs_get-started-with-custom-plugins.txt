Suggest Edits
Sigma supports plugin elements in workbooks. Plugins are third-party applications built to add additional functionality into an existing product. For example, a software developer in your organization may create a plugin that allows you to display your data in a chart type that isn't supported in Sigma.
You will only have access to plugins registered with your organization.
Where do I start?
Your starting point with Sigma Custom Plugins is dependent on your role, experiences, and purpose. To get started, find the scenario below that best matches your current situation:
Scenario #1: I’m interested in using my organization’s existing custom plugins.
To understand how to create plugin-based workbook elements, see Use Your Organization's Plugins.
Scenario #2: I’m an organization Admin or developer interested in exploring what plugins can do for my organization.
We recommend getting started with one or more example plugins already created by Sigma’s development team. All of our example plugins are hosted and can be added to your organization. You don’t have to be a software developer to try them in Sigma.
Visit Example Plugins to get started.
Scenario #3: I’m a developer who wants to build custom plugins for Sigma.
To get started, see Develop Sigma Plugins. Our API documentation is available at Plugin Development API.
You can also read through the source code for Sigma’s example plugins, located in the Sigma’s Sample Plugin repository on Github.
Scenario #4: I’m an organization Admin looking to make a plugin available to my team.
Ready to get one of your development team’s plugins up and running? See Register a Plugin with Your Organization.
You can also make any of Sigma’s example plugins available to your team through the same registration process.
