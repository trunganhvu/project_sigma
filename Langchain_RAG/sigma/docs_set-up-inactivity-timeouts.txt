Set up inactivity timeouts
Suggest Edits
Sigma allows you to configure inactivity timeouts. These timeouts ensure users are automatically logged out after a certain length of inactivity in the product. This can help protect sensitive information and prevent unauthorized access to confidential data.
Activity in the product includes any mouse movement or keystroke input on Sigma tabs. Activity in other tabs is not registered.
