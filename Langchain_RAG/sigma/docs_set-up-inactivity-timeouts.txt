Set up inactivity timeouts
Suggest Edits
Sigma allows you to configure inactivity timeouts. These timeouts ensure users are automatically logged out after a certain length of inactivity in the product. This can help protect sensitive information and prevent unauthorized access to confidential data.
Activity in the product includes any mouse movement or keystroke input on Sigma tabs. Activity in other tabs is not registered.
User requirements
You must be assigned the Admin account type to set up inactivity timeouts for your organization.
Set up inactivity timeouts
Go to Administration > Authentication.
In Authentication Method & Options, select Edit.
Turn the Enforce Inactivity Timeouts toggle on.
Enter your desired time interval before users are logged out in the Inactivity Timeout in Seconds field. The minimum time interval you can enter is 5 minutes (300 seconds), and the maximum is 12 hours (43,200 seconds).
Select Save.
Limitations
Inactivity timeouts will not apply to embeds.
