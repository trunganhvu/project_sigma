Area charts
Suggest Edits
You can create a chart from the Add element section of the workbook, or directly from an existing data element.
Visualized data does not display on the page canvas until all required plot fields are defined.
Add columns to open fields and marks using either the + menu or dragging and dropping the column.
Required Fields
X-AXIS (1+ columns)
Y-AXIS (1+ columns)
Columns added to the Y-AXIS field are aggregated by default. Aggregation type (e.g. Sum vs Count) is dependent on the original column’s value type (e.g. text, number, date, etc).
For example, a numeric column such as 'Sales Amount' creates a new calculated column, 'Sum of Sales Amount' (e.g. Sum([Sales Amount])).

No Stacking - Areas start from the X axis and might overlap
Stacked - Areas stack on top of each other
Stacked 100% - All areas add up to 100% of the area
