Use comments in workbooks
Suggest Edits
You can add comments to workbooks, and individual workbook elements, to provide context for visualizations or controls, solicit feedback, or make requests. Add a quick comment or start a conversation about a workbook with your colleagues.
When you add comments, make sure that your workbook is published or saved. If you want to add comments to an exploration, you must first save the exploration as a new workbook. If you add comments to a workbook in Explore mode, publish your changes or save your exploration as a bookmark before commenting.
