Suggest Edits

Usage
Left(string, number)
string (required) The string from which a left substring will be returned.
number (required) The desired length of the returned substring. A negative number removes the number of characters from the end of the string.
Example
Left("Dec. 12, 1950", 3)
Returns “Dec”
Left("St. Louis", 20)
Returns “St. Louis”
If number is greater than the length of string, the result is the original string.
Left("San Francisco", -5)
