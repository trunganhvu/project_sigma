Everything New We’ve Launched in Our Product This Year
JANUARY 31, 2024
Sigma’s Year in Review is a lot of content, so strap in. In the last year, we’ve launched more than 66 features and updates, including: three new visualizations, four array functions, 10 financial functions, 14 geography functions, 14 improvements to chart layouts, 12 new API endpoints or response fields, 15 new URL parameters for embeds, six new features to make modeling in Sigma easier, two new ways to connect to Sigma, five features to improve workbook analysis, 7 features to improve workbook sharing consumption, five features to make Admins’ lives easier, one entirely new workbook layout system, and one new workbook element that allows users to input data. 
In 2023, we set out to: 
Deliver the best in class analytics and BI experience
Challenge the industry by redefining the way users engage with data
Make our user experience intuitive and delightful for all users
To achieve our goal, we’ve released some amazing features. Here were our greatest hits this year:
The Big Three: 
Input Tables: You can now write back data into the warehouse just like a spreadsheet. Enter data directly into Sigma and bring it together with data from your warehouse, marrying flexibility and scale. 
Version Tagging: This allows you to employ a software development cycle to control workbook versions using tags. For example, orgs can have a development, staging, and production version of a workbook and migrate changes and swap connections as needed.
Period Over Period Workflow:  Generate dynamic period comparisons without entering complex custom formulas. Anyone can quickly create comparisons in just a few clicks. 
The Rest of the Greatest Hits
Visualizations: We’ve leaned into data visualization and presentation-style workbooks more than ever. Style your tables, make charts of every kind on the fly, and more. 
Grid Layouts: Our new grid layout system includes the option to customize mobile layouts. 
Bookmarks: Create a bookmark on any workbook to save your personal view, while still inheriting any updates that are made to the underlying workbook.
Annotated Screenshots: Capture and annotate element screenshots, then share them in workbook comments to preserve point-in-time data and add important context to discussions
Filters and Controls: Previously when creating a control, you had to choose if the control was going to apply filters to elements, or if it was going to be referenced as a parameter. Now, a control can both apply a filter and be referenced as a parameter.
Financial Functions: Sigma added support for several common financial functions. 
Flexible Data Modeling: Sigma’s Metrics feature boosts your organization’s metrics governance and helps you perform standard calculations with ease and efficiency.
Column-Level Security: Column-Level Security provides granular control over data access.
Custom Functions: Use custom functions in your Sigma practice to encode business logic instead of repeating it. Define custom functions as a combination of Sigma functions, or create an easily referenceable version of user defined functions (UDFs) from your data warehouse. 
Workbook Materialization: We now offer the ability to materialize workbook elements, in addition to datasets. 
OAuth for Embeds: Embedding customers can enhance authentication security using OAuth.

User Attributes: Sigma added the ability to configure two user attributes on your Snowflake connection: Warehouse and Role.

Audit Logging: The Sigma Audit Log is a connection that provides data related to user-initiated events that occur within your Sigma organization.
