You can send a custom-filtered report to a dynamic list of recipients as a scheduled email burst. For example, you might send individual sales representatives their individual quarterly performance numbers for all categories of product that they sell. Because each sales rep is only responsible for one region, customize the report to provide relevant region-specific data, and filter the elements on the page with a page control for the store region.
In this example, the sales rep assigned to the West Store Region would receive this report as an email attachment in her email inbox:
Limitations
When exporting as an email burst, certain limitations apply:
The control that you split by must be a list control with values sourced from a column. You can split by a maximum of 500 values.
The split by column must be a number or text data type.
The source of the dynamic recipients must be a column in the same data source that the list control is sourced from. You can send to a maximum of 500 dynamic recipients.
The size limit for emailed exports is 30MB. This is the total limit for all attachments when combined. If an export exceeds this limit, the entire export fails and the owner of the scheduled export is notified. Scheduled exports that repeatedly exceed this limit are automatically paused and their owner notified. See Download, export, and upload limitations.
ðŸš§
When executing a scheduled export or direct download to PDF or PNG formats, Sigma may store applicable control values as URL parameters in trace logs used for debugging and troubleshooting purposes. Exercise caution when exporting or downloading workbook content that uses controls to filter sensitive data.
Requirements
You must be assigned an account type with the Export as email burst permission enabled.
Have Can Edit or Can Explore access to the individual workbook.
ðŸ“˜
If your organization restricts email traffic sent from specific IP addresses, add 198.37.153.185 to the allowlist. Alternatively, you can configure a custom SMTP server to use instead. See Custom SMTP server.
Schedule an email burst
From the workbook menu (), select Schedule export....
If this is the first schedule for the workbook, click Add Schedule, otherwise click + New schedule.
(Optional) You can define conditions for when Sigma sends the export. To turn on conditions, click the Condition toggle. Conditions are evaluated separately for each split by control value. For more information, see Schedule exports using conditions.
Select Export as email burst.
For Split by..., select a control to use as the split-by value.
Choose recipients for the email burst. You can include both dynamic and standard recipients:
For Dynamic recipients, select a column from the data source used to populate the list control used as split-by values. Dynamic recipients receive only the attachments relevant to the associated split by control value. Leave empty to send all attachments to a static list of recipients.
For Standard recipients, enter one or more comma-separated Sigma teams, Sigma users, or email addresses. Combined with Dynamic recipients, you can email up to 1,000 total recipients. Standard recipients receive all attachments.
ðŸ“˜
If export authentication is configured for your organization by an admin, you can only send the export to email addresses associated with an authorized domain. For Standard recipients When you attempt to create the schedule, Sigma notifies you if an email address contains a domain that's not allowed. For Dynamic recipients, emails to restricted addresses are not sent. See Restrict export recipients.
(Optional) In the Subject field, enter a subject line.
(Optional) In the Email Body field, enter a message.
