Array functions
Suggest Edits
Array functions create, manage, and manipulate arrays (lists of indexed values).
Array Returns an array containing specified values.
ArrayContains Searches for a specific value in an array. If the value is found, the function returns True, otherwise it returns False.
ArrayDistinct Returns the array without duplicate values.
ArrayIntersection Compares two arrays and returns an array of all overlapping elements, without duplicates.
ArrayJoin Joins elements of an array into a single text string.
ArrayLength Determines the number of entries in an array, or list.
ArraySlice Returns a portion of an array, defined by the starting index and length.
Sequence Returns an arithmetic sequence as an array of integers based on a specified range and increment
The following aggregate functions also create arrays:
ArrayAgg Identifies non-null row values in a column or group and aggregates them into a single array.
ArrayAggDistinct Identifies distinct non-null row values in a column or group and aggregates them into a single array.
