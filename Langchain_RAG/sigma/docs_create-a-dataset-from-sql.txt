Create a dataset from SQL
Suggest Edits
You can create datasets by writing SQL against the data in your warehouse.
Requirements
To use this feature, you must be assigned an account type with the permission to write custom SQL.
To run custom SQL, you must have the Can use data permission for the entire connection. See Data permissions.
The SQL editor only appears if you have connection-level access to at least one connection in your organization.
To reference existing Sigma datasets and workbook elements within your SQL, you must have write access configured on your connection.
Create a dataset by writing custom SQL
To create a new dataset by writing your own SQL query against your data:
Open Sigma Home.
In the navigation panel, click Create New, then select Dataset.
On the Select a Data Source page, click Select under SQL.
In the side panel, click Select a Connection and select the connection you want to query.
In the query editor, enter your custom SQL. Sigma provides autocomplete suggestions to guide you.
Reference existing Sigma datasets
You can reference your existing Sigma dataset in your SQL by using the fully qualified name as a view inside the warehouse. This is a combination of the dataset Location and view name:
SELECT * FROM <location>.<dataset_warehouse_view_name>
To determine the fully qualified name of the dataset, select when viewing a dataset to open the information panel:
The Location field provides the database and schema in your CDW that contain the dataset, and the Dataset field provides the view name that you can reference.
ðŸ’¡
To copy the fully qualified name to your clipboard, click the more ( ) icon, then select Copy path.
For the dataset shown in the screenshot, you can retrieve all columns of the dataset with the following example SQL:
SQL
SELECT * FROM SIGMASUPPORT.WRITE_BACK.VIEW_MY_SIGMA_DATASET
To reference individual columns from your Sigma dataset in your SQL, wrap the column name in double quotes. For example:
SQL
SELECT "Customer Id" FROM SIGMASUPPORT.MATERIALIZATION.VIEW_NEW_DATASET_FROM_SQL_A4438843B7604999A324C84265EE695E
Reference dataset parameters
You can reference Sigma parameters in your SQL by wrapping the parameter's name in curly brackets:
{{my_parameter_name}}
If the parameter's value is output with single quotation marks, you can remove these quotation marks by prepending the keyword #raw before the parameter name:
{{#raw my_parameter_name}}
If the parameter is from a Date range control, you can extract the start and end date:
{{my_parameter_name}}:start and {{my_parameter_name}}:end
Limitations and warnings
If you change the value of a parameter, make sure that the tables use the same schema.
If you use the #raw parameter value, row-level security can be bypassed in the worksheet, creating a security vulnerability.
Reference multi-select list parameters
Multi-select list controls pass the multi-selected data as an array.
