FirstNonNull
Suggest Edits
Returns the first non-null value in a column or grouping.
FirstNonNull() can be used as either an aggregate function or a window function. When used as a window function, it repeats the first non-null value for every row in the column.
This is similar to the First() function, but excludes null values.
Syntax
FirstNonNull(value)
Arguments
Term Description
value
A column to reference or a formula to calculate. The first non-null value is derived from input. 
All column types are accepted.
Notes
Consider data sort order when using this function:
All sorting and/or filtering is applied prior to calculating this function.
If no sort order is explicitly set, Sigma doesn't force one. In this case, sort order is determined by your Cloud Data Warehouse.
Examples
Example 1
This example shows the most recent non-null date from the [Delivery Date] column for each grouping under the [Order Number] column.
FirstNonNull([Delivery Date])
[Delivery Date] is sorted descending. If instead, [Delivery Date] was sorted ascending, the function would return the least recent non-null date for each grouping.
Example 2
This example is similar to Example 1, but instead of using FirstNonNull() as an aggregate function, it is used as a window function. This means the calculation references a column in the same group, instead of referencing a column in a lower group. As a result the first non-null value is returned for every row.
The resulting calculations are dependent on the groupâ€™s sort order. In this example, the group of columns in which FirstNonNull() is calculated is sorted by the [Product Family] column. This sort order impacts the order of the [Delivery Date] column, which is then passed to FirstNonNull() in the [Calc] column.
