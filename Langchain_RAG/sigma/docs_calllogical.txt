CallLogical
Suggest Edits
The CallLogical function calls a warehouse function that returns a Logical datatype. This function if often applied to perform array comparison, creation, and manipulation for analysis.
Syntax
CallLogical(function name, argument1, argument2, ...)
Function arguments:
function name (required): The name of the warehouse function to call.
argument (required): The argument(s) to pass into the warehouse function. Multiple arguments are supported. 
Example
A table contains a Today SKU column that returns an array of top SKU Numbers for each store and a LW Today SKU column that returns an array of top SKU Numbers from the previous week. You can pass Snowflake's ARRAYS_OVERLAP function to the CallLogical function to compare whether each store has at least one high demand SKU Number from the previous week. 
CallLogical("ARRAYS_OVERLAP", [LW Today SKU], [Today SKU])
Return True if Today SKU and LW Today SKU arrays have at least one SKU Number in common.
