7 Ways Sigma Can Transform Your Finance Operations
OCTOBER 9, 2024
Finance teams have historically relied on manual processes and spreadsheets, but are facing increasing pressure to deliver real-time insights. Enter Sigma—a modern, cloud-native analytics platform redefining how finance teams work with data. Imagine a tool that lets you connect directly to live data, collaborate in real time, and perform complex analyses without writing a single line of code. With Sigma, you’re not just keeping up with the pace of business—you’re setting it.
Whether you’re grappling with financial reporting, scenario planning, or compliance, Sigma empowers you to move faster and make more informed decisions. In this blog, we’ll explore seven powerful ways Sigma can streamline your finance operations, helping you navigate the complexities of modern finance with confidence and ease.
Real-time data exploration and analysis
Connect directly to live data: Traditional finance tools often require manual data uploads or working with stale spreadsheets, creating delays and increasing the risk of errors. Sigma enables users to connect directly to live data sources, ensuring the usage of the most up-to-date data. This allows finance teams to make real-time decisions, providing a significant advantage when quick, accurate decisions are crucial. Imagine how this could streamline operations during critical deadlines, like end-of-quarter reporting.
Interactive analysis without the wait: Sigma’s easy to use interface is designed for speed and efficiency. As you explore your data, Sigma processes your queries instantly, allowing you to drill down into details and pivot data—no more waiting for reports to refresh or relying on IT to generate new views. You’re in control of your analysis—all in real-time.
Empower your team: With Sigma, everyone on your finance team can become a data analyst. The platform’s easy to learn nature means that even those without deep technical expertise can independently explore data and generate insights. Unlike other BI platforms, Sigma truly enables a self-service data strategy model reducing bottlenecks and empowers your team to take ownership of their analyses, driving faster, more informed decision-making across the organization.
Automated financial reporting
Create custom reports and dashboards without IT: In many organizations, finance teams rely heavily on IT to generate custom reports and dashboards. Sigma changes this dynamic by allowing you to create custom reports and dashboards independently, reducing delays and miscommunication. With its intuitive drag-and-drop interface, you can easily build and tailor reports to your needs without writing a single line of code. 
Collaborate in real-time: Sigma’s real-time collaboration features enable your finance team to work together seamlessly, regardless of location. Real-time collaboration means multiple team members can work on the same report simultaneously, viewing and editing data as it updates. This enhances productivity and fosters a culture of teamwork and transparency, ensuring everyone is on the same page.
Automate routine tasks: Sigma doesn’t just simplify reporting—it automates it. With Sigma, you can set up automated workflows to generate and distribute reports regularly. This frees up your team’s time to focus on more strategic tasks, reducing the burden of manual reporting and minimizing the risk of errors. Imagine cutting your reporting time by 50%—a real possibility with Sigma’s automation capabilities.
Advanced calculations without code
Perform complex calculations with ease: With traditional finance tools, performing advanced calculations often requires deep technical knowledge or reliance on IT teams. Sigma changes this by making complex calculations extremely simple using built-in functions and formulas—no coding required. Whether you're calculating EBITDA, ROIC, variances, growth rates, or other complex financial metrics, Sigma provides a straightforward spreadsheet interface that makes advanced analytics accessible to everyone on your team.
Self-service analytics for the win: Unlike other BI tools that have failed to deliver on the promise of self-service, Sigma’s spreadsheet like interface and simple calculation syntax makes the platform truly accessible for all users. This self-reliance speeds up decision-making and empowers your team to act on insights as soon as they’re uncovered.
Bridging the gap between finance and data science: With Sigma, the line between finance and data science becomes blurred. Sigma’s ability to handle advanced calculations allows finance teams to engage in more sophisticated analyses that were previously the domain of data scientists. This capability expands what your finance team can achieve and enhances the strategic value they bring to the organization.
Scenario planning and forecasting
Model various business outcomes with dynamic scenario analysis: Finance teams must be able to anticipate and prepare for different outcomes. Whether forecasting revenue under different market conditions or assessing the impact of potential business decisions - Sigma is equipped with powerful dynamic scenario analysis tools, allowing you to easily model various business scenarios. 
Data-driven forecasting with accuracy: Traditional forecasting methods often rely on historical data and static models, leading to inaccurate predictions. Sigma leverages real-time data and sophisticated analytics to create data-driven forecasts that are more accurate and reflective of current conditions, which helps finance teams generate forecasts that truly guide strategic decisions.
Stay ahead of the curve: With Sigma, you’re not just reacting to change—you’re predicting it. The platform’s forecasting capabilities allow finance teams to stay proactive, identifying potential challenges and opportunities before they arise. This forward-thinking approach ensures that your organization is always prepared to navigate whatever the future holds.
Write-back to source systems
Directly update your data with write-back capabilities: One of Sigma's most valuable features is writing back to your data sources, enabling finance teams to analyze data and take action directly within the platform. Imagine adjusting budgets, revising forecasts, or updating financial metrics in real time without leaving Sigma. This feature bridges the gap between analysis and execution, making it easier for finance professionals to incorporate real-time insights into their workflows and maintain consistency across their data systems.
Reduce manual data entry: Sigma’s write-back functionality reduces the need for repetitive, manual data entry into multiple systems. You can update records or adjust financial metrics instantly, ensuring that changes are reflected across all relevant systems in your business. This feature saves time, minimizes errors, maintains a single source of truth, and enhances the overall efficiency of financial operations.
Enhanced Security
Row Level Security: Sigma’s row-level security (RLS) feature grants authorized users access to particular data rows based on their responsibilities or permissions held within the organization. This empowers finance teams to manage the visibility of sensitive data like salary records and confidential financial indicators by limiting access at the row level without creating numerous dashboards or datasets.
CDW Rules Apply: Sigma enables organizations to apply the same security rules and groups in their CDW to their Sigma environment. This allows organizations to streamline their access and permissioning by leveraging business rules that are already established. Not only does this make managing permissions more efficient and consistent throughout the organization, but it also saves them time and money.  
Compliance and audit readiness
Maintaining compliance with clear audit trails: Tracking every financial decision and data point can be daunting, especially when audits occur. Sigma simplifies this process by providing clear audit trails that document every change, query, and action taken within the platform. This transparency ensures that your finance team can easily trace data back to its source, making compliance efforts more manageable and reducing the stress associated with audits.
Data governance that protects your financial integrity: Sigma’s robust data governance features ensure that your financial data is always secure and compliant with industry regulations. With fine-grained access controls, you can define who sees what data and how they can interact with it. This level of control protects sensitive information and ensures that your team adheres to best practices in data handling and compliance. Whether you're aligning with SOX, GDPR, or other regulatory frameworks, Sigma has you covered.
Be audit-ready at all times: Sigma enables your team to always be audit-ready instead of scrambling to prepare for audits. The platform’s built-in compliance and data governance features mean that your financial records are always organized, accessible, and up-to-date.
