Export to Google Sheets
Suggest Edits
You can send one or more individual workbook elements to Google Sheets on a set schedule or an as-needed basis. When you export to Google Sheets on a schedule, the same Google Sheet is replaced (overwritten) each time the schedule runs. See Schedule an export to Google Sheets
Sigma generates exports from the workbook's latest published version. Draft changes are not exported.
