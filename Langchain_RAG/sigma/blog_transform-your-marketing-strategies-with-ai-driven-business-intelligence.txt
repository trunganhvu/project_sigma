Transform Your Marketing Strategies with AI-Driven Business Intelligence
Real-time data access and interactive BI tools are non-negotiables for today's marketers. That’s what has made Sigma such a killer app for marketing teams—including our own—who want to leverage cutting-edge insights without a learning curve.
But a better BI on its own isn’t enough to keep pace with the demands of modern marketing teams. You need to build your strategies with AI.
Why think about this today? Because your job will depend on it. AI will not replace all marketers—just those marketers who don’t use AI.
Marketers here at Sigma think about this across everything we do: How can we leverage AI in BI to make decisions faster with more precision and accuracy?
Welcome to the New Era of Marketing with AI
Ditch the old playbook. With Sigma’s AI toolkit, marketers can step into a world of precision and personalization. With Sigma you can analyze vast data sets at lightning speed, uncovering patterns and trends that were previously out of reach. This also means you can craft campaigns that resonate deeply with your audience, fostering stronger connections and driving brand loyalty.
Deep Dive into Customer Insights
Imagine having a crystal ball for your marketing strategies. By pairing your data with AI, you get deep insights into customer preferences, behaviors, and pain points. By integrating data from social media, website interactions, and purchase history, you get a 360-degree view of your audience. This allows you to tailor your campaigns with laser-like accuracy.
Concrete example: Sigma’s Director of Product Marketing Mallory Busch recently used Sigma and Snowflake Cortex to instantly analyze user quotes for marketing research. 
“This is deep-thinking work that otherwise would have taken me hours,” she said.
How’d she do it? 
Step 1: Add Gong quotes into Sigma (“I truly just copy-and-pasted a list into the spreadsheet UI,” she said.)
Step 2: Write a function calling on Snowflake Cortex. (Sigma’s Head of Partner Engineering David Porter showed her how to do this. And once she learned the basics, she was able to edit it herself.)
Step 3: Get AI-generated results, in seconds.
“This is what we mean when we say Sigma makes self-service, ad hoc analysis a reality for every role,” she said.
Real-Time Campaign Optimization
Why wait for end-of-quarter reports to tweak your marketing strategies? With AI, you get real-time feedback on your campaigns. Paired with Sigma, you could analyze performance data continuously, highlighting what's working and what isn't. This empowers you to make swift adjustments, ensuring your resources are always focused on the most effective strategies.
Predictive Analytics: Your New Secret Weapon
‍Predictive analytics is another game-changer. Forecast future trends and customer behaviors, allowing you to stay ahead of the curve. Imagine launching campaigns with the confidence that they will resonate and succeed because you have predictive insights guiding your decisions.
Personalization at Scale
Today’s consumers don’t just welcome personalization; they expect it. With AI and Sigma you could make personalization at scale possible—and seamless. 
Consider AI-powered email marketing. You could send personalized content to each subscriber based on their past interactions with your brand. This approach doesn't just improve customer satisfaction; it drives higher open and click-through rates, significantly boosting your ROI.
Streamline and Simplify
Let AI take the wheel in data analysis, freeing your team to focus on what they do best—strategizing. Sigma’s tools simplify routine tasks, from reporting to performance tracking, enhancing your team’s productivity and efficiency. Routine tasks like reporting and performance tracking? Use Sigma to streamline this work, increasing your team’s efficiency and productivity.
