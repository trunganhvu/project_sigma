Required
The text, date, or number to convert to number
Sigma interprets Dates that are converted to numbers as Unix-style timestamps or the number of seconds after January 1st, 1970.
Examples
Number("15.25") Number(15.25)
Both forms return 15.25.
Number("5.073456E10") Number(5.073456E10)
Both forms return 50734560000, because it interprets E as exponent notation.
Number("22253908723450973459872359073459073459073549734597")
Returns 2.2253908723450973e+49, compacting the number into exponent notation.
Number("953,486")
Returns Null, because it does not interpret the comma as a thousands separator.
Number("75%")
Returns Null, because it does not interpret the % as a percentage
Number("$75.347")
Returns Null
Number("#876")
Returns Null, because it does not interpret the # as hexadecimal indicator.
Number("N") Number("True") Number("False")
All these return Null, because the arguments are not numeric.
Number(2023-07-12 22:58:26)
Returns 1689202706 or the number of seconds between January 1st, 1970 and the date value.
