Concat
Suggest Edits
The Concat function combines text strings.
Usage
Concat(string_1, string_2, ...)
Function arguments:
string_1 (required) First string to combine in the sequence.
string_2+ (optional) Additional strings to combine in the sequence.
Concat doesn't automatically add spaces between strings. To add a space in the output, include " " as its own argument.
To include a number or date value as a string, place quotation marks around the value ("2024-01-01").
To treat values in a number column as text strings, enclose the column name in the Text function (Text([Column])).
Example
Concat("queen", "bee")
Returns queenbee.
Concat("queen", " ", "bee")
Returns queen bee.
Concat ([Name], Text([ID No]))
Combines a column of names with their corresponding ID numbers.
Concat([Store Region], "\n", [Store State])
When the newline character (\n) is added as an argument, Concat generates the subsequent argument on a new line. To view the output on separate lines, ensure Wrap text formatting is applied to the column.
