Enable OAuth for embeds
Suggest Edits
This feature allows embedding customers to enhance authentication security using OAuth. See Configure OAuth.
Secure tokens are passed, as an Embed API parameter, to Sigma. This authenticates users into Sigma's embedded analytics to drive granular user permissions.
To use OAuth for embeds:
In your CDW, leverage row-access policies that are defined for individual embedded users.
Encrypt the token using AES with the same embed secret string that you generated for this embed in Sigma's admin portal.
Enter the <oauth_token> parameter into the embed URL.
