Suggest Edits
Admins can specify an organization’s locale by going to Administration > Account > General Settings > Locale.
Setting the locale allows you to serve the Sigma users in your organization and consumers of embedded analytics with content in their preferred language.
Requirements
You must be assigned the Admin account type.
Set the organization locale
Sigma supports two locales that you can set as the base locale for your Sigma organization:
English (en)
English (Great Britain) (en-gb)
The default locale is English (en). When you switch to the English (United Kingdom) (en-gb) locale, dates display as DD/MM/YYYY or Day Month Year, and time displays in the 24-hour format.
To change the organization locale:
Go to the Administration > Account > General Settings tab.
Under Locale, click Edit.
Use the drop-down menu under Account Locale to select your preferred locale.
Click Save.
