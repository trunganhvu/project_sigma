Intersects
Suggest Edits
The Intersects function determines if one geography intersects another geography.
You can use the Intersects function on Snowflake and BigQuery connections.
Intersects is one of Sigma's Geography functions.
Syntax
Intersects(geography1, geography2)
The function arguments are:
geography1
Required
The first geography that many be intersecting with the next geography
geography2
Required
The second geography that many be intersecting with the previous geography
Examples
Intersects(Geography("POLYGON((0 0, 2 0, 2 2, 0 2, 0 0))"), Geography("POLYGON((1 1, 3 1, 3 3, 1 3, 1 1))"))
The function returns True.
Intersects([Brooklyn], [Queens])
If we define the Brooklyn and Queens boroughs as a polygons (see Geography functions overview for coordinates), then the Intersects function returns True because they share a waterway; see the following illustration.
