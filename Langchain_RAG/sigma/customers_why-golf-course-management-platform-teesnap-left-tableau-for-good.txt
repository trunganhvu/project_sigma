Why golf course management platform Teesnap left Tableau for good
By Jim Wood
VICE PRESIDENT OF PRODUCT & TECHNOLOGY, TEESNAP LLC
Jim Wood is the VP of Product & Technology at Teesnap. Teesnap offers a comprehensive digital platform primarily designed for golf course managers, streamlining operations through an integrated suite of software solutions. Teesnap enables golf course operators to enhance their efficiency, improve customer engagement, and leverage data-driven insights for better decision-making. While the platform is aimed at golf course managers, its benefits extend to the consumers by providing a seamless golfing experience through efficient booking and payment processes.
Life before Sigma 
One huge challenge was related to the lengthy time it took to refresh our data, which prevented users of the system from being able to make timely decisions. Other limitations we encountered were the performance issues experienced with Tableau that were truly unacceptable, and caused users to have to wait many times for minutes before the report would even render.
After transitioning to the Sigma platform coupled with Snowflake, we observed an immediate performance enhancement, exceeding 90% on our most complex report.
The performance issues experienced with Tableau were simply unacceptable.
The decision to integrate Sigma into our platform was based on its strong alignment with our key objectives: driving innovation, achieving market leadership, and enhancing customer satisfaction. Sigma's potential to significantly boost performance, its cost-effectiveness, and the promise of a solid return on investment were critical factors that underscored its suitability for our company, my role as VP of Product & Technology, and the golf industry.
Life with Sigma 
Since incorporating Sigma into our workflow, the transformation in how my team and I interact with each other has been significant. Sigma has provided us with a collaborative platform that greatly enhances our ability to explore, analyze, and visualize data. This has facilitated a more cohesive and efficient working environment. 
We can now share insights quickly and base our decisions on solid data. The platform's user-friendly nature, coupled with its seamless integration with Snowflake, has streamlined our processes and boosted our team's productivity by enabling features like automated user creation, no downtime, and a one-click deployment process. The accessibility and speed at which we can now access data are impressive.
Sigma has not only improved our operational efficiency but also opened up new avenues for leveraging AI capabilities that we are just beginning to explore.
Sigma opens up new avenues for AI 
A standout example of Sigma's impact is its role in enhancing our data accessibility and processing speed. Our customers now have access to an extensive history of data, well beyond the three years we could offer in the past. This wealth of information is crucial for informed decision-making in areas such as marketing and promotions. Sigma has not only improved our operational efficiency but also opened up new avenues for leveraging AI capabilities that we are just beginning to explore. This level of analysis and insight was previously out of reach and marks a significant milestone in our journey towards fully realizing Sigma's potential.
The ease of use and easy deployment of embedded reports within our SaaS platform was a huge win. No longer having to maintain servers and updates for our Tableau environment helped our team to focus on more important tasks. Our infrastructure and engineering team has been able to run much more efficiently without long nights dealing with updates and deployments within Tableau.
How Sigma affects pricing and profitability 
Sigma's integration within our platform has significantly improved our ability to produce real-time data analysis, which I am confident will open doors for innovation within our platform. We are currently exploring methodologies to harness this data, aiming to improve our customers' profitability via dynamic pricing models and to boost user engagement. This strategic direction not only aligns with our core objectives but also positions us at the forefront of leveraging data-driven insights for real business results.
