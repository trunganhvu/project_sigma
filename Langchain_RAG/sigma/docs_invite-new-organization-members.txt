You can invite new members to your organization from the Administration portal. This document explains how to invite new members and resend or delete pending invitations.
System and user requirements
The ability to invite new password-authenticated members to your Sigma organization requires the following:
You must be assigned the Admin account type.
ðŸš§
If your organization uses only SAML or OAuth to authenticate members, you must first assign new members in the IdP or authorization server. If a member receives an invite before this step is complete, they see an IdP error and will be unable to log in to Sigma.
Invite a new member
To invite a new user to your Sigma organization:
Go to Administration > People:
