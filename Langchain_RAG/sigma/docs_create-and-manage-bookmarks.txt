Sigma supports personal bookmarks for individual use.
Personal bookmarks
Personal bookmarks allow you to save the state of a published workbook in Explore or View mode. In a published workbook, you can make changes to the filters, controls, and other elements, and save the changes as a personal bookmark.
All user interactions persist in the bookmark. Some common things you might want to bookmark include:
Saving a control or filter value
Adjusting the formula for a column (such as a mapping column)
Adding a new visualization
Adding descriptive information in a text element
Renaming elements or pages
For example, say your team uses a standard workbook that you regularly modify for your own purposes. Instead of making a copy, you set the filters or controls that you want and save it as a personal bookmark. Then you can set your bookmark as your default view of the workbook. When the underlying data updates, your personal bookmark updates as well. This saves you a lot of time compared to copying, and keeps the context of the standard workbook.
In short, you donâ€™t need to make your changes to a static copy of a workbook. The bookmark keeps its connection to the original published workbook, so if the original published workbook changes, the changes become available in the bookmark. This also applies to a URL you may copy from a saved bookmark; the URL wonâ€™t become stale.
Create a personal bookmark
Requirements
Your user account must have Viewer, Creator, or Admin privileges. For more information see User account types.
Access to the published workbook. Workbook owners can share published workbooks. For more information see Share a workbook.
Steps to create a personal bookmark
Go to the workbook and make changes, such as selecting a filter value or adding a new element. What you can change in a workbook depends upon your user account and the workbook's permissions. For more information see Workbook modes overview: View, Explore, Edit.
From the Published menu, select Bookmark your changes.

The Save Bookmark modal opens. 
Name your bookmark.
(Optional) If you want the bookmark to be your default view of the workbook, check Always view bookmark by default.
Click Save.
Access and manage a personal bookmark
After you add a bookmark, the Personal bookmarks menu becomes active. Use it to select your saved bookmarks.
To rename, set as default view, or delete a bookmark use the Manage bookmarks menu and modal.
Tip: If you forget to save a bookmark, use the Published > Recent explores menu to display your recent explorations, find the one you want, and bookmark it.
Workbook changes that affect bookmarks
Sometimes a workbook changes in such a way as to make its bookmarks out-of-date or even irrelevant. This can happen when the bookmark includes:
A filter whose value was changed, and the workbook deletes or updates the filter. 
A filter on an element that was later deleted in the workbook. 
An element that was later deleted in the workbook.
In cases like these, Sigma alerts you with a modal prompting you to either delete the bookmark or update it.
Simple changes to the workbook that do not relate to edits you make for a bookmark do not prompt an alert. Simple changes, such as updated titles, appear when you open the bookmark. 
The following example shows changes to a workbook and creating a personal bookmark, as well as the Manage Bookmarks modal.
