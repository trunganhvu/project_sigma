Operators overview

Sigma supports basic operators for calculations, evaluating them in accepted order. You can use these operators when developing the conditions of Logical functions.
Sigma supports the following operators:
Example
When calculating values, such as using the addition operator + to add two values, the result is Null if one of the values is Null.
[Column 1] + [Column 2]
If the value of [Column 2]  is Null, then the result of the entire formula is Null.
To resolve this, you can apply the Zn function to each value, to substitute 0 for Null:
Zn([Column 1]) + Zn([Column 2])
