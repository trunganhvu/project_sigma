Pie and donut charts
Suggest Edits
Pie and donut charts are a good way to visualize data as a percentage of a total.
Requirements
To create a data element, you must have Can Edit access to the individual workbook and be in Edit mode.
Many exploratory actions are also supported in Explore mode; see Workbook modes.
Plot options
You can create pie and donut charts charts from the PAGE ELEMENTS section of your workbook's editor panel, or directly from an existing data element.
Required fields
COLOR (1 column)
VALUE (1+ columns)
Columns added to the VALUE field are aggregated by default. Aggregation type (e.g. Sum vs Count) is dependent on the original columnâ€™s value type (e.g. text, number, date, etc).
Example: A numeric column [Sales Amount] will create a new calculated column [Sum of Sales Amount].
Marks
TOOLTIP: choose columns to show when hovering over points in the chart
TRELLIS: select columns to serve as Trellis Rows or Columns, splitting the chart into separate charts
