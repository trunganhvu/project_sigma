If you change the authentication method from password to SSO or OAuth, user emails must exactly match for the user to maintain their account.
Manage authentication method and options
To manage the authentication method and options for your organization, do the following:
Open your Admin Portal by selecting Administration in the user menu at the top right of your screen.
Select Authentication in the left navigation panel.
Under Authentication Method & Options, click Edit.
For Authentication Method, select an authentication method from the dropdown menu.
If you select SAML or SAML or password, see Single Sign On with SAML.
If you select OAuth or OAuth or password, see Configure OAuth.
If you select Password, continue to follow these steps.
[optional] To enable guest user accounts, turn on the toggle for Allow Guest Access. See Guest User Accounts.
[optional] To customize how frequently users are prompted to re-authenticate, set a Session Length in Hours. This setting only applies to users logging in with SAML or a password.
[optional] To authorize anyone with an email from one or more domains to create an account in your organization without a personalized invite, specify one or more comma-separated email domains under Company Domain Signup. For more details, see Company domain signup.
After configuring authentication for your organization, click Save.
Company domain signup
When you use an authentication method that supports Password authentication, you can choose to add domains to an allowlist. By default, new users can only sign up when they receive an invitation. Adding your company's email domain lets anyone with a company email address create a Sigma account without a personalized invitation.
Sigma prompts new users to enter their email from a domain on the allowlist. After confirming their email, the user can create an account and register as a Sigma user.
Admin-initiated password reset
If you are assigned the Admin account type and your organization is using a password-based authentication method, you can send password reset emails to users in your organization:
In the Admin Portal, click the People tab.
On the Members tab, search or browse to locate the user. You can search by name or email address.
For the user, click More > Reset user password.
Sigma sends a reset password email to the user. The email informs the user that the organization admin has requested that they reset their password.
Bulk password reset
If you are assigned the Admin account type and your organization is using a password-based authentication method, you can initiate a password reset for multiple users.
In the Admin Portal, click the People tab.
On the Members tab, for each user, select the checkbox to the left of their name.
In the toolbar, click Reset password.
Review your selection and click Confirm.
The selected users receive an email informing them that the admin has requested that they reset their password.
