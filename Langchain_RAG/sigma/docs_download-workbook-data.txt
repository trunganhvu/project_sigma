If you attempt to export a workbook while editing it, you only have the option to download the draft version. If you want to download the published version or export to other destinations, open the published version of the workbook.

When executing a scheduled export or direct download to PDF or PNG formats, Sigma may store applicable control values as URL parameters in trace logs used for debugging and troubleshooting purposes.
