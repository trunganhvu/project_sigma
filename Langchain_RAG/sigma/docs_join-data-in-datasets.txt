Join Data in Datasets
Suggest Edits
When creating a join between warehouse tables or datasets, there are times where you need to make changes to the data in the input columns to make the join work. In those cases, you can add a formula to your input columns while creating a join.
You can define you join key with a scalar formula, using any of the functions available in Sigma. The formula can be as simple as a Type Change function, or a complex If statement.
