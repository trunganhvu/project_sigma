Lookup
Suggest Edits
The Lookup function finds matching data inside a workbook data element, either in the same table, or in an external table.
To understand how to apply the Lookup function without directly using the formula bar, see Add columns through Lookup.
All elements must be on the same data connection.
Syntax
Lookup(formula, local key 1, external key 1, [local key 2], [external key 2], ...)
This function has the following arguments:
formula
Required
The formula to compute (or the target column to reference) for the row in the target element.
local key 1
Required
The column to use as a join key in the local data element.
external key 1
Required
The column to use as a join key in the target data element.
local key 2
Optional
The additional column to use as a join key in the local data element.
external key 2
Optional
The additional column to use as a join key in the target data element.
Examples
Lookup([Customers/Cust Name], [Cust Key], [Customers/Cust Key])
Data is inserted into the Sales tableâ€™s [Calc] column from the Customer tableâ€™s [Cust Name] column.
These two tables are joined using a single column (join key) from each table. In this case, both join keys are named [Cust Key].
The functionâ€™s formula parameter directly references a column in the joined table.
ðŸ“˜
In formulas, reference columns from other tables with the [table name/] prefix (e.g. [Customers/Cust Name]).
Data is inserted into the Ordered Items tableâ€™s [Calc] column from Customer tableâ€™s [Zip Code] column.
The functionâ€™s formula parameter directly references a column in the joined Customers table.
These two tables are joined using two sets of join keys:
Order Itemsâ€™ [Cust Name] column is joined with Customerâ€™s [Name] column;
Order Itemsâ€™ [Cust Key] column is joined with Customerâ€™s [Cust Key] column
Lookup(Sum([Sales Amounts/Sales Amount]), [Order Number], [Sales Amounts/Order Number])
Data is inserted into the Orders tableâ€™s [Calc] column from Sales Amount tableâ€™s [Sales Amount] column.
The functionâ€™s formula parameter uses the Sum function to aggregate values from the Sales Amount tableâ€™s [Sales Amount] column.
These two tables are joined using a single set of join keys: Ordersâ€™ [Order Number] column is joined with Sales Amountsâ€™ [Order Name] column.
