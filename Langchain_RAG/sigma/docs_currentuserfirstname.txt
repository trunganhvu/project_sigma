CurrentUserFirstName
Suggest Edits
The CurrentUserFirstName function returns the current (signed-in) user’s first name as configured in the user’s profile.
To return the user's full name or email address, use the CurrentUserFullName or CurrentUserEmail function.
Syntax
CurrentUserFirstName()
📘
CurrentUserFirstName has no function arguments because it’s context-sensitive and doesn’t depend on any explicitly provided values.
Example
The VP of Sales creates a Sales Performance workbook and implements row-level-security so each Sales representative can only view their own performance data. For added personalization, the VP adds a text element that contains the message “Hey there,” and a dynamic value that references the CurrentUserFirstName function followed by an exclamation point.
When Jim Halpert logs into Sigma and views the Sales Performance workbook, the text element displays “Hey there, Jim!”
Likewise, when Stanley Hudson logs in and views the same workbook, the text element displays a “Hey there, Stanley!"
