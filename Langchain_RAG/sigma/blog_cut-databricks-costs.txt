Master Databricks Billing and Usage: How Sigma’s New Template Makes It Incredibly Easy
Try the Template Now
Get excited: You can now harness the full potential of your Databricks environment with Sigma’s newest template. 
Databricks recently introduced system tables in Public Preview, offering an unprecedented level of visibility into your data, billing, and usage patterns.
While these tables provide a treasure trove of insights, extracting actionable information from them can be a daunting task for many users. That’s where Sigma steps in.
We've developed a powerful Billing Usage template designed to transform this complex data into clear, actionable insights, making it accessible to everyone, regardless of technical expertise. With Sigma, you can now easily track, analyze, and optimize your Databricks costs and usage, empowering your team to make smarter, data-driven decisions in real-time. Ready to see how it works? Let's dive in.
What Sigma's billing usage template offers
This powerful template is designed to give you a clear, comprehensive view of billing for compute resources within your Databricks account. This template is essential for anyone wanting to understand Databricks billing and usage because it fully breaks down your spending, covering all computing aspects, including all-purpose, job, interference, and SQL warehouses. Everything is presented in a single, easy-to-understand dashboard, making it accessible to users of all technical backgrounds.
The template ensures that no detail is missed by providing visibility across various workspaces within your account. This holistic view makes it simple to identify spending trends, spot inefficiencies, and make informed, data-driven decisions to better manage your technology budget.
The billing overview doesn’t just stop at a high-level summary. It also dives deeper, offering insights into the specific SKUs being utilized on a weekly and daily basis. This level of detail is crucial for teams aiming to manage their resources effectively, avoid unexpected costs, and ensure that every dollar is well spent.
How this template can benefit you
This template is designed with practicality in mind. It utilizes fabricated data from Databricks system tables that closely mirror the actual data in your instance. The key advantage of this approach is that you can easily swap in your own data, allowing the template to generate insights specifically tailored to your account and workspaces.
Enable the necessary schemas: Begin by importing our Databricks Python notebook to set up the required schemas within your Databricks instance. This step is crucial for establishing the foundation needed for Sigma to access and analyze your data. Detailed instructions are available in the Read Me tab of the Template, and you can also refer to Databricks documentation for further guidance.
Swap in your own data: Once the schemas are enabled, our guide on data swapping will take you through the process of replacing the fabricated data in the template with your own. This ensures that the insights generated are specific to your account and workspaces.
Customize the template: The template is fully customizable. Whether you want to integrate additional system tables from your catalog or make other modifications, our documentation provides the steps you need to tailor it to your unique requirements.
