BinFixed
Suggest Edits
The BinFixed function computes the bin for a value among the specified number of identically sized bins within the given bounds.
Syntax
BinFixed(value, min, max, bins)
Function arguments:
value (required): The value for which the bin is computed.
min (required): The lower bound. If the value is less than min, the bin will be 0.
max (required): If the value is greater than or equal to max, the bin will be bins + 1.
bins (required): The number of bins within the interval. Bins are numbered 1 through bins. If bins is less than 1, all values will treated as belonging to bin 1.
Example
The values in the Days Since Signup column are assigned to one of 5 bins:
BinFixed([Days Since Signup], 0, 90, 3)
This function places all numbers less than 0 in bin 0, all numbers 90 or greater in bin 4, and all numbers between 0 and 90 are assigned one of 3 equally sized bins. 
Using bins helps simplify a column to show the duration since the last signup:
