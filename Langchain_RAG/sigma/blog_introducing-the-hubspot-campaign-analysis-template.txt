Introducing the HubSpot Campaign Analysis Template
JULY 20, 2023
Unleash Insight and End the Extract
Sigma is thrilled to introduce the HubSpot Campaign Analysis Template.  This template is built on the instantly deployable Fivetran HubSpot Quickstart data model and empowers marketers by providing actionable insights into their email campaigns to identify trends that drive engagement. Moreover, users can seamlessly build and deploy campaigns within Sigma, pushing them directly to HubSpot through our integration with Hightouch, eliminating the need for manual extracts and streamlining your workflow.
The Insights You Need
We built the HubSpot Campaign Analysis template to augment the reporting native in HubSpot and allow users to dive deeper.  This template provides a comprehensive understanding of your campaign performance by showing key metrics such as click-through rates, open rates, and bounce rates over time and with granular control to compare campaigns and learn what works. Users can connect this template to any other data source in Sigma and begin leveraging insights to optimize marketing strategies effectively, reaching new audiences with impactful campaigns.
Sigma’s HubSpot Template is built on top of Fivetran’s Quickstart data model.
End the Extract
The Sigma HubSpot template benefits extend beyond insights. With the HubSpot Campaign Analysis Template, you can seamlessly translate insights into action. Build your campaign strategy directly within Sigma, leveraging our intuitive interface and robust features. Once crafted, push your campaign effortlessly to HubSpot through our integration with reverse ETL tool, Hightouch, ensuring a streamlined and efficient workflow.

With Only Clicks
The best part about our solution? It is all clicks from start to finish. You start the data movement by easily authenticating Fivetran's fully managed connector. The Quickstart data model helps you transform data into the analytics-ready tables you need in your warehouse with all clicks in their UI - no code, dbt project, or 3rd party tools required. This entire ELT pipeline is synchronized and performant.
The insights are then fully unlocked by downloading the Template in Sigma and pointing to the tables that the Quickstart data model created. And just like that, you are optimizing your existing campaigns and creating your next best one!
