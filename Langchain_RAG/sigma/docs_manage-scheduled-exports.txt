Manage scheduled exports
Suggest Edits
You can view and manage scheduled exports, such as to stagger the schedules of exports, remove no longer needed scheduled exports, or to update the configuration of a scheduled export.
Manage schedules for a workbook.
Manage scheduled exports that you own or subscribe to.
As an admin, manage all scheduled exports for your organization.
ðŸ’¡
If you have multiple scheduled exports, it's a best practice to stagger the schedules. Staggering schedules helps to reduce the load on Sigma and on the data warehouse.
