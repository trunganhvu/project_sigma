Manage data permissions
Suggest Edits
With additive data permissions, you can manage grants for individual users and groups (the entire organization or configured teams) at the connection level or for specific databases, schemas, and database tables.
This document explains how to view, add, edit, and revoke data permission grants. For information about the additive data permissions model and available data permission types, see Data permissions overview.
🚩
Data permission grants only affect members assigned account types (default or custom) using the Pro license.
Members assigned account types using Lite or Essential licenses can only view datasets and applicable workbooks (and only when the View datasets and View workbooks account type permissions are enabled).
User requirements
To view, add, edit, and revoke data permission grants, you must be assigned the Admin account type or be granted Can admin data permission for the connection.

User-level permission type availability depends on whether the user meets the account type permission requirements. The dropdown only displays permission types the user is qualified to inherit.
Group-level permission type availability is unrestricted, regardless of whether all members qualify for the grant. However, individual members only inherit the group-level grant if assigned the required account type permissions.
For more information about account type permission requirements, see Data permissions overview.

[optional] If sending an email notification, enter a message in the Add a Message field to provide additional context.
