Introducing Python in Sigma Snowflake Native App Now Available on Snowflake Marketplace
JUNE 4, 2024

Earlier this year, Sigma unveiled a notebook-style Python experience and now at Snowflake’s annual user conference, Snowflake Data Cloud Summit ‘24, Sigma announced the launch of a new native app, Python in Sigma Snowflake Native App, now available in the Snowflake Marketplace.
With Python in Sigma Snowflake Native App, Python users can produce dynamic applications using a notebook-style experience for their entire business to access, engage with, and iterate on natively within Snowflake. In combination with the core Sigma platform, the app empowers business users to harness the full power of Snowflake through a familiar spreadsheet UI. The Python in Sigma Snowflake Native App provides business users with another way to analyze, visualize, and collaborate—all at the scale and speed of business demands.
Why Python in Sigma Snowflake Native App?
Gartner estimates 85% of machine learning (ML) projects fail due in part to the lack of domain expertise of the development team which hinders collaboration with the business teams. The Python in Sigma Snowflake Native App was built to solve just that—it successfully bridges the gap between your business and data science all within the same product. Your entire organization is granted access not just to the analysis but also to data scientists, enabling them to explore, build, and iterate together on live data securely in real-time.
The Python in Sigma Snowflake Native App provides a fully managed experience for data scientists to run containers with ML models, APIs, and web-based interfaces. By leveraging Snowpark Container Services, Sigma provides a full Python editor that is directly integrated into Sigma Workbooks. With this latest release, every team member can contribute live using the medium of their choice or switch between spreadsheets, SQL, or Python to build a complete narrative together.
Users can build applications, analyze data, and turn predictions into actionable insights natively within Snowflake, bringing business and data teams even closer for joint Sigma and Snowflake customers.
Python in Sigma Snowflake Native App in Action
When writing Python in Sigma, users can build and execute code incrementally. But the Python in Sigma Snowflake Native App does more than that. Users can also leverage any of the other data and analysis within Sigma—even jumping between languages or the UI—to tell a complete and cohesive narrative, and build the applications they need.
The Python in Sigma Snowflake Native App unlocks an unprecedented way for teams to collaborate across their tech stack and quickly on the insights that mean the most for the business. Together, Sigma and Snowflake are working to mobilize the world’s data with Snowflake’s AI Data Cloud, helping joint customers unlock the value of their data.
