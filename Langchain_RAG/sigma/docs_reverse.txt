This function is useful for making text functions that normally work forwards from the beginning of a string, such as Mid or Substring, to instead work backwards from the end of the string.
Usage
Reverse(text)

Example
Reverse("desserts")
Returns “stressed”
[Extract Area Code (Failure)] = Mid([Phone Number], 5, 3)
[Extract Area Code (Success)] = Reverse(Mid(Reverse([Phone Number]), 6, 3))
