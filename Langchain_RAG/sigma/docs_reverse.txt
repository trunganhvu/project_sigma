Reverse
Suggest Edits
The Reverse function reverses the order of the characters in a string.
This function is useful for making text functions that normally work forwards from the beginning of a string, such as Mid or Substring, to instead work backwards from the end of the string.
Usage
Reverse(text)
text (required)- Text or a column of text that you want to reverse.
Example
Reverse("desserts")
Returns “stressed”
[Extract Area Code (Failure)] = Mid([Phone Number], 5, 3)
[Extract Area Code (Success)] = Reverse(Mid(Reverse([Phone Number]), 6, 3))
