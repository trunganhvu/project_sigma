Make Faster, Smarter Decisions with Sigma’s Glean Integration
SEPTEMBER 17, 2024
The data you need is often scattered across different systems—structured sources, like your data warehouse, and semi-structured sources, like email logs, Jira tickets, or even Slack messages. These sources are rich in context, yet traditionally siloed and disconnected.
But the real power of your data—and the insights it holds—comes to life when every piece of relevant information is unified. That’s why our upcoming integration with Glean is so special.
Glean’s AI delivers enterprise search across the semi-structured sources your company relies on—documents, support tickets, and conversations. Now, we’re bringing that power into Sigma. When you uncover insights and need to act, you can instantly access additional context by searching Glean with just two clicks.
Whether it’s a customer report or a Slack conversation, Sigma and Glean bring all the data together so you can work smarter, not harder.
How the Integration Works: A Supply Chain Operations Demo 
Let’s say you’re managing supply chain operations and monitoring critical metrics like shipping times and supplier delays. You notice a shipment delay coming from one of your major suppliers, and you need to get to the bottom of it quickly.
Here’s how the Sigma’s Glean integration can help:
Spotting an Issue in Sigma
You begin by reviewing a Sigma dashboard that tracks shipping delays broken down by suppliers. You notice a spike in delays from one particular supplier over the past week.
Using Glean to Find Unstructured Context
To understand what’s happening, you right-click on and search with Glean for relevant communications and reports. While still in Sigma, Glean opens and pulls in information from various sources. There might be a Slack or an internal email thread discussing the reasons for the delays–or, you could find a report from the supplier that mentions temporary staffing shortages affecting shipments.
Taking Action Based on Insights
Once you have the full context—from both the structured data in Sigma and the unstructured communications found through Glean—you can act quickly. You can adjust expectations, communicate with stakeholders, and make decisions to mitigate further delays, all without jumping between different systems.
The Benefits for Engineering Teams and Beyond 
By merging the power of structured and semi-structured data, Sigma’s integration with Glean enables you to get answers faster and with greater confidence, whether you’re troubleshooting operational issues or collaborating with your team.
It also streamlines workflows—reducing the need to switch between systems so teams can stay focused and productive—ultimately speeding up decision-making and problem-solving.
Unleash the Power of Your Data with Sigma and Glean
Together, Sigma and Glean will unlock a new level of efficiency for your team. Whether you’re troubleshooting a production issue or looking for deeper insights, this integration helps you work faster by bringing all your data—structured and unstructured—into one workflow.
