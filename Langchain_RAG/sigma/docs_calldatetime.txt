CallDatetime
Suggest Edits
The CallDatetime function calls a warehouse function that returns a datetime data value. This function is often applied to display a time column or value in different formats that require conversion.
Syntax
CallDatetime(function_name, argument)
Function arguments:
function_name The warehouse function to call.
argument One or more arguments to pass to the warehouse function.
Example
A table contains a Daily Total Seconds column that returns the session time (in seconds) for each customer as a Number type. You can pass Snowflake's TO_TIME function to the CallDatetime function to represent the number of seconds as hours, minutes, and seconds.
CallDatetime("TO_TIME", Text([Daily Total Seconds]))
Converts the Daily Total Seconds column into hours, minutes, and seconds.
ðŸ“˜
Apply custom formatting to the CallDatetime column using %H:%M:%S as the format string to only display the time portion of the timestamp returned by the TO_TIME function.
