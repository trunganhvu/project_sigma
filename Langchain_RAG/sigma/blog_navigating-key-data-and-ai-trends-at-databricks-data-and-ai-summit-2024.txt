Navigating Key Data and AI Trends at Databricks Data and AI Summit 2024

Data Analytics experts and thought leaders Max Benjamin, Managing Partner and Head of Analytics at Aimpoint Digital, and Mitch Ertle, Databricks Partner Solutions Engineer at Sigma, are here to discuss the most important trends and themes at this year’s summit. Let’s dive into the future of data and AI.
Mitch: Max, let’s jump right in.
What key themes are top of mind for you this year to learn about at Databricks Data and AI Summit?
Max: For me, I definitely plan to explore AI deployment and operationalization, particularly LLMOps, to understand how we can better effectively implement AI solutions at scale. Real-world applications, like dynamic pricing for retail, offer valuable insights into best practices and industry use cases. 
Mitch: Absolutely, I echo those sentiments. The convergence of AI and data analytics is a pivotal theme. I'm particularly interested in sessions like "Introduction to DBRX and other Databricks Foundation Models," which delve into leveraging foundational AI models for driving innovation. Additionally, topics related to data sharing protocols and accessibility of AI, such as Delta Sharing and AI Functions in SQL, are key areas of focus for me this year. On the topic of accessibility of analytics and AI, I'm particularly interested in exploring embedded analytics and the opportunities it affords. This demonstrates how organizations can monetize data by integrating analytics directly into their products, or identify brand new ways to monetize data easier and more flexibly.
Max, how do you see these themes shaping the future of AI and data analytics in the industry?
Max: These themes are indicative of a broader trend towards democratizing access to AI and making data-driven decision-making more accessible to businesses of all sizes and all teams in the business. By leveraging advanced analytics and AI technologies, organizations can gain deeper insights into their data, optimize processes, and drive innovation. The future of AI and data analytics lies in empowering businesses with the tools and knowledge to harness the full potential of their data assets.
Mitch: I couldn't agree more. The democratization of AI and data analytics remains a top priority of Sigma’s and key to driving widespread adoption and unlocking new opportunities across industries. As companies continue to invest in AI and data analytics capabilities, we'll see a shift towards more agile, data-driven decision-making processes, and multimodal tools that actually make these easier to use. Ultimately, these themes are driving a fundamental transformation in how businesses operate and compete in the digital age.
Max, I’ve added your lightning talk to my DAIS agenda,  "Dynamic Pricing with Databricks and Sigma". What can I and other attendees expect to learn from it? Also, what are some other sessions you recommend?
Max: During my lightning talk, you'll learn about cutting-edge dynamic pricing models, how to integrate them into data applications, and their role in driving profitability. This session will be valuable whether you are in the retail industry or looking to operationalize analytics. Another session I recommend for those interested in operationalizing AI is "A Practitioner’s Perspective on LLMOps," which offers valuable insights into managing AI models for long-term value. I'm particularly excited about sessions covering real industry applications through detailed case studies. Aimpoint Digital has outlined our top session picks in this blog.
