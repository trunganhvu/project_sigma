System and user requirements
You must be assigned the Admin account type.
You must have the necessary permissions in your cloud data warehouse (CDW) to create a write access destination and configure permissions.
Set up destinations and permissions for write access in your data platform
To set up write access, ensure that Sigma has sufficient permissions in your data platform.
Each CDW has a unique database structure and permissions model. Follow the documentation for your CDW to create a destination that Sigma can use to write data back to, and apply the necessary permissions to allow Sigma to perform write back using the authentication you have configured.

By design, the destination that you configure for write access is not visible in the Sigma connection explorer pane. The data that Sigma writes to this destination is not formatted in a way that can be browsed and used. Configure a separate database or a database and schema combination for write-access purposes.
Configure write access in Sigma
Select Administration in the user menu at the top right of your screen.
Select the Connections page from the left panel.
To view the connection, click on an existing connection in the list.
Click Edit.
Under Write access, switch on Enable write access.
Sigma requests additional information for write access; this information depends on the specifics of your CDW: Snowflake, BigQuery, PostgreSQL, Redshift, Databricks, AlloyDB, and MySQL.
After completing the form, click Save.
