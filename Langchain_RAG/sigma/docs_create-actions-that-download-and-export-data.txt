Create actions that download and export data
Suggest Edits
Workbooks support actions that initiate direct downloads and exports to email, Slack channels, webhooks, and cloud storage.
This document explains how to create actions to download and export workbook content to specific destinations. For more information about actions in Sigma, see Intro to actions.
User requirements
ðŸ“˜
The following requirements apply to users who configure actions. Users who access and interact with a workbook can typically trigger all existing actions within it. Any restrictions are noted in this document.
The ability to configure actions requires the following:
You must be assigned an account type with the Full explore or Create, edit, and publish workbooks permission enabled.
You must be the workbook owner or be granted Can explore1 or Can edit workbook permission.
1
If youâ€™re granted Can explore workbook permission, you can configure actions but cannot save changes to the workbookâ€™s published version.
Initiate direct download
Create an action that downloads an entire workbook, a specific page, or an individual element directly to the interacting userâ€™s device.
ðŸ“˜
This action can only be configured and triggered by users assigned an account type with the Download or Send Now permission enabled.
Open a workbook in Explore or Edit mode.
Select the trigger element (the element users must interact with to initiate the action), then click Actions in the side navigation.
In the Actions panel, click Add action in an existing sequence, or click Add action sequence to create a new one.
In the Action modal, configure the required fields to define the response:
Action Select Download and export.
Destination Select Download.
Attachment Select the workbook content to download, then choose a file type.
If the trigger element is a table, pivot table, or input table, configure additional settings that determine when and how user interaction triggers the action sequence:
To trigger the action sequence only when a user selects a cell in a specific column, click the dropdown following the On select heading and select the column. To trigger the action sequence when a user selects a cell in any column, select Any column.
[optional] To control whether keyboard navigation within the element can trigger action sequences on the element, click More in the Actions panel, then select Allow keyboard to trigger actions. When the option displays a checkmark, keyboard navigation and pointer events (e.g., mouse clicks) can trigger the action sequences. When the option doesn't display a checkmark (default), only pointer events can trigger them.
ðŸ’¡
Keyboard navigation as a trigger interaction can disrupt the user experience. For example, if the element's action sequences include actions that open links or other workbooks, a user can be unintentionally navigated away from their current task. This can be particularly disruptive if the action sequence can be triggered by selecting a cell in any column.
Consider allowing keyboard navigation to trigger actions only when it facilitates the configured action sequences and is unlikely to interfere with usability.
[optional] To execute the action sequence only when a specific condition is met, click More in the action sequence, then select Add condition and configure the criteria. For more information about conditions, see Define an action condition.
Export to email
Create an action that emails an entire workbook, a specific page, or an individual element to selected recipients.
ðŸ“˜
This action can only be configured and triggered by users assigned an account type with the Download or Send Now permission enabled.
Open a workbook in Explore or Edit mode.
Select the trigger element (the element users must interact with to initiate the action), then click Actions in the side navigation.
In the Actions panel, click Add action in an existing sequence, or click Add action sequence to create a new one.
In the Action modal, configure the required fields to define the response:
Action Select Download and export.
Destination Select Email.
Recipient Enter one or more comma-separated email addresses for the export recipients.
Subject Enter text to include in the email subject line.
Message [optional] Enter a message to include in the email body.
Attachment Select the workbook content to export, then choose a file type.
More options [optional] Select the Include link to workbook checkbox to allow the export recipient to open the workbook directly from the email.
[optional] Select the Run queries as recipient checkbox to run workbook queries as the recipient of the email. If deselected (default), queries run as the user who performs the action.
[optional] Select the Send as .zip file checkbox to send attachments as a compressed zip file.
If the trigger element is a table, pivot table, or input table, configure additional settings that determine when and how user interaction triggers the action sequence:
To trigger the action sequence only when a user selects a cell in a specific column, click the dropdown following the On select heading and select the column. To trigger the action sequence when a user selects a cell in any column, select Any column.
[optional] To control whether keyboard navigation within the element can trigger action sequences on the element, click More in the Actions panel, then select Allow keyboard to trigger actions.

Export to Slack
Create an action that exports an entire workbook, a specific page, or an individual element to Slack.
ðŸ“˜
This action can only be configured and triggered by users assigned an account type with the Export to Slack permission enabled.
Open a workbook in Explore or Edit mode.
Select the trigger element (the element users must interact with to initiate the action), then click Actions in the side navigation.
In the Actions panel, click Add action in an existing sequence, or click Add action sequence to create a new one.
In the Action modal, configure the required fields to define the response:
Action Select Download and export.
Destination Select Slack.
To Enter the name of a Slack channel that must receive the export.
Message [optional] Enter a message to include in the Slack notification.
Attachment Select the workbook content to export, then choose a file type.
More options [optional] Select the Include link to workbook checkbox to allow channel members to open the workbook directly from the Slack message.
If the trigger element is a table, pivot table, or input table, configure additional settings that determine when and how user interaction triggers the action sequence:
To trigger the action sequence only when a user selects a cell in a specific column, click the dropdown following the On select heading and select the column. To trigger the action sequence when a user selects a cell in any column, select Any column.

ðŸ“˜
This action can only be configured and triggered by users assigned an account type with the Export to webhook permission enabled.
Open a workbook in Explore or Edit mode.
Select the trigger element (the element users must interact with to initiate the action), then click Actions in the side navigation.

Action Select Download and export.
Destination Select Webhook.
Endpoint Enter the receiving applicationâ€™s endpoint.
Attachment Select an element to export, then choose a data format.
If the trigger element is a table, pivot table, or input table, configure additional settings that determine when and how user interaction triggers the action sequence:
To trigger the action sequence only when a user selects a cell in a specific column, click the dropdown following the On select heading and select the column. To trigger the action sequence when a user selects a cell in any column, select Any column.
