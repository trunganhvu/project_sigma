Introducing Explore Mode in Embedded Analytics
MAY 22, 2024
Embedded analytics connects the power of Sigma dashboards and charts into a product or application, so that an organization’s customers can access and analyze the data that’s most important to them. Many companies leverage embedded analytics platforms to accelerate their time to market, drive user engagement, and monetize their data while avoiding having to build anything from scratch, which often results in higher development costs, slower time to market, and a poor overall customer experience.
Fundamentally, Sigma is a proponent of providing enterprises with low-risk, self-service analytics capabilities and these enhancements take that experience and environment a step further providing new ways for customers to analyze, interact, and access their data.
With Explore Mode, Sigma is enhancing the embedded user experience by providing more ways for users to engage with the data and charts provided to them, and lets organizations deliver an even more valuable and customized end user experience. 
What is Explore Mode?
Explore Mode empowers individual users to interact with data without altering or copying the original workbook. Legacy business intelligence platforms require users to duplicate countless copies of a dashboard to perform ad hoc analyses, creating confusion among users and introducing risk for an organization. In Sigma, it’s easy for users to dynamically interact with their data, refine visualizations, and derive insights directly within the dashboard interface. 
Users can add new elements, change groupings on existing elements, or update a pivot table to perform their own tailored analysis and to make better, more data-informed decisions.
Because users aren’t changing the dashboard itself, but instead just doing an exploration on top of the dashboard, they can explore worry-free and organizations can rest assured that the underlying data is safe and secure.
Many organizations leverage embedded analytics as a vehicle to monetize their data and unlock new revenue streams. Explore Mode takes this one step further and allows for additional license options in a product or application, creating even more flexible paths to monetization. Customers are no longer limited to a basic “viewer” license of the data—they can now deeply explore the data themselves, and organizations can charge a premium for this access.
Understanding the Different User Capabilities
The Explore Mode functionality is broken down into two user permissions–Basic Explore and Full Explore. These permissions should be leveraged to curate the right feature experience for your customers.
Basic Explore enables users to view and interact with explorations and published workbooks and offers lightweight customization. Users with Basic Explore have the added ability to drill into data, filter columns, and enter input table data. Basic Explore is recommended for users who need to access prepared data and insights and need some drill-down capabilities in published workbooks but don’t need to modify the workbooks themselves.
Full Explore enables the entire scope of interactions and customizations in Explore Mode. Users are granted all of the capabilities in Basic Explore plus the ability to modify workbook elements to create custom views of published workbooks. Full Explore might be granted to power users who model, transform, and analyze data.
For a comprehensive comparison of the granular user capabilities, review the user permission breakdown. To get started setting up permissions for your customers, navigate to the administration portal and follow these steps. 
Conclusion
With Explore Mode, Sigma is bringing a level of customization to embedded analytics that no other business intelligence tool provides. Embedded users can access data in a way that increases self-service capabilities without exposing an organization’s data to any risks.
With these enhancements, companies have the tools to build out the best possible data experience for their customers without the need for engineering support. Sigma not only provides the tools to analyze data—Sigma gives organizations a single platform to build data applications, unlock new revenue streams, and bring their users closer to the data so they can make smarter, more informed decisions to drive their business forward.
