Documentation memo
This document references the audit log with its default column settings and connection configurations. If settings and configurations were customized by an Admin user, column visibility and naming in your audit log may differ.
To confirm column visibility and identify the default columns defined in this document, refer to the Column tab in your audit log. If necessary, you can cross-reference your audit log's custom “friendly names” with cloud data warehouse (CDW) or database management system (DBMS) column IDs provided in the event metadata tables throughout this document.
