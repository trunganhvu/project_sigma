Review warehouse view details
Suggest Edits
The Warehouse Views page in the Administration portal provides a centralized location to review details of all warehouse views created by users in your organization. The page allows you to search for and check the status of specific warehouse views, verify or copy view paths, and reference audit history, including who created a view and when it was created and last updated. You can also determine the location of a view’s source element and navigate directly to that workbook.
This document explains how to utilize the Warehouse Views page in the Administration portal. For information about creating, renaming, and deleting views, see Create and manage workbook warehouse views.
