Round
Suggest Edits
The Round function rounds a number to the specified number of digits. When digits is not specified, the number is rounded to the nearest whole number by default.
Usage
Round(number, [digits])
Function arguments:
number (required) Number to be rounded.
digits (optional) Number of decimal places to round the number. If not provided, defaults to 0.
The underlying formula is as follows:
(number/10^digits) * (10^digits)
ðŸ“˜
A negative digits value returns an integer with the specified least-significant digits zeroed.
ðŸ“˜
Rounding is different than formatting. The result can have fewer digits than specified. Rounding does not add trailing zeroes.
Example
Round(Pi())
Returns 3
Round(3.1, 2)
Returns 3.1
Round(1234, -2)
Returns 1200
