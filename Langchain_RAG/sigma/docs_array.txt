Array
Suggest Edits
The Array function returns an array containing specified values.
ðŸ“˜
This function isn't compatible with all data platform connections. To check if your connection supports it, see Supported data platforms and feature compatibility.
Syntax
Array([values])
Function arguments:
values
[optional] Comma-separated values used to construct the array.
Values can include a variety of input, including integers, strings, boolean values, columns, and results of function calls.
ðŸ“˜
The Array function supports indexing using a zero-based indexing system. To retrieve a value in the array based on its position, append the index in square brackets directly following the function call. For a demonstration, see Example 3.
Examples
Example 1
Array(1, 2, 3)
Returns the array [1,2,3] as variant data.
Example 2
Array(1, "Hello", Today())
Returns the array [1,"Hello","2024-03-14 00:00:00.000 Z"] when the current date is March 14, 2024.
Example 3
Array("red", "orange", "yellow")[1]
Because the array has an index range from 0 to 2, [1] instructs Sigma to access the value in the second position, which returns "orange".
