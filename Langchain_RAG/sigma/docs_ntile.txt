Ntile
Suggest Edits
The Ntile function assigns the rows of a column to a given number of ranks. An approximately equal number of rows is given each Ntile rank. The ranks are assigned in order.
Syntax
Ntile(ranks, [Column], direction)
Function Arguments:
ranks (required) - The number of ranks to assign. Must be an integer greater than 0.
[Column] (required) The column used to rank the table.
direction (optional) The direction to sort the input column. Enter “asc” to sort ascending and “desc” to sort descending. The default sort is ascending.
Example
Ntile(4, [Population 2010])
A table contains the population of different counties in 2010.  The table is grouped by a [State] column. Using the Ntile function, an equal number of rows will be ranked 1, 2, 3 and 4 according to the size of the [Population 2010] column. Since the direction is not specified it will default to ascending. Therefore, the lowest quartile of values in [Population 2010] will be ranked 1 and the highest quartile of values will be ranked 4.
Ntile(4, [Population 2010], "desc")
Here, the direction argument is "desc", so the rank will be assigned descending. Therefore, the highest quartile of values in [Population 2010] are ranked 1 and the lowest quartile of values are ranked 4.
