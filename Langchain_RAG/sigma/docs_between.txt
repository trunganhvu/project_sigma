Between
Suggest Edits
The Between function checks whether a value lies within a given range. If the value is within the specified lower and upper bound, the function returns True, otherwise it returns False.  
Syntax
Between(value, lower bound, upper bound)
Function arguments:
value (required)  The input value or column containing the values to check.
lower bound (required) The lower bound of the range to check.
upper bound (required) The upper bound of the range to check.
ðŸ“˜
The Between function is inclusive, so it includes the beginning and end values of the range.
Example
Between([Invoice Date], MakeDate(2015, 1, 1), MakeDate(2020, 1, 1))
Returns True if a date value is between January 1, 2015 and January 1, 2020. 
ðŸ“˜
If Invoice Date is a timestamp, the Between function considers the range between January 1st, 2015 00:00:00 to January 1st, 2020 00:00:00. Any timestamp after 12 am is NOT considered.
Returns True if an event occurred between 4AM and 6AM on July 25th, 2024.
Between([Sale Date], DateAdd("day", -7, Now()), Now())
Returns True if a sale happened in the last 7 days.
Between([Date], [date-range-param].start, [date-range-param].end)
Returns True if a date value is within the date range selected in the Date Range parameter (parameter returns start and end date as a JSON object).
Between([Order Count], [number-range-param].min, [number-range-param].max)
Returns True if a number is within the number range specified in the Number Range parameter. 
(Between(Day([Week]), 7, 14) and Month([Week]) = 3) or (Between(Day([Week]), 1, 7) and Month([Week]) = 11)
Returns True if a date value belongs to the week where Day of March is between 7 and 14 OR if a date value belongs to the week where Day of November is between 1 and 7.
ðŸ“˜
