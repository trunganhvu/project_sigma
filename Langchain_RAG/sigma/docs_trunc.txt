Usage
Trunc(number, [digits])
number (required) The number to be truncated
digits [optional] The number of decimal places to which to round. Defaults to 0.
If "digits" value is negative, the function will return an integer with that many least-significant digits zeroed (see example 4 below).
Examples
(1) Returns 5.24
Trunc(5.2463, 2)
(2) Returns 5.
Trunc(5.678)
(3) Truncates the value in each row of the input column to 3 decimal places.
Trunc([Cost], 3)
(4) Rounds the input number down and replaces its last 2 digits with 0s. A negative "digits" value returns an integer with that many least-significant digits zeroed.
Trunc([Cost], -2)
