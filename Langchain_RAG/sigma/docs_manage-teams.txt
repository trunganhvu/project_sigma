Create and manage teams
Suggest Edits
Teams allow you to create user groups in Sigma. When you grant access and permissions to a team, the grants apply to all members assigned to the team.
This document explains how to create, edit, and delete teams in Sigma. For information about managing team members and team admins, see Manage team members and Manage team admins.
ðŸ“˜
If your organization uses an identity provider (IdP) to manage users and teams, see Manage users and teams with SCIM.
User requirements
To create teams, you must be assigned the Admin account type. To edit team details and delete a team, you must be assigned the Admin account type or be assigned Team Admin status.
Create a team
Go to Administration > Teams:
In the Sigma header, click your user avatar to open the user menu.
Select Administration to open the Administration portal.
In the side panel, select Teams.
In the Teams page, click Create Team.
In the New Team page, provide the team details:
In the Team Name field, enter a unique name to identify the team.
(optional) In the Team Description field, enter a description about the team and its members.
In the Team Access section, select an option to determine who can access the team:
Public
Accessible to the entire organization (guest and embed users excluded).
For example, all organization users can perform the following:
View the team and its details in the Profile > Teams > Public teams tab.
Grant the team permissions to folders and documents.
Private
Accessible to team members only.
For example, only team members can perform the following:
View the team and its details in the Profile > Teams > My teams tab.
Grant the team permissions to folders and documents.
(optional) To create a workspace for the team and automatically grant members Can contribute permission, select the Create a workspace associated with the team checkbox.
ðŸ“˜
Teams and workspaces have a many-to-many relationship. A single team can be granted different permissions for multiple workspaces, and multiple teams can be granted different permissions for a single workspace. For example, your organization can create a workspace for each team while also maintaining quarterly workspaces shared with a select few teams.
For more information about workspaces, see Manage workspaces.
Click Create to save the new team.
