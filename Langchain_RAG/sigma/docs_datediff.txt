DateDiff
Suggest Edits
The DateDiff function calculates the time difference between two dates.
Syntax
DateDiff(unit, start, end)
The function has the following arguments:
unit
Required
The unit to measure the difference.
Can be one of “year”, "quarter", “month”, “week”, “day”, “hour”, “minute”, “second”, “millisecond”.
start
Required
The starting date
Note that the value must be a date. If the column is not in the appropriate format, use the Date function on the argument.
end
Required
The ending date
Note that the value must be a date. If the column is not in the appropriate format, use the Date function on the argument.
Sigma rounds the result to the nearest integer. If the ending date precedes the starting date, the output is a negative integer.
Examples
DateDiff(“day”, [Invoice Date], Today())
Returns the number of days between the date in the Invoice Date column and the current UTC date.
DateDiff("year", [Invoice Date], Date("2018-01-01")) = 8
Returns the number of years between the date in the Invoice Date column and January 1, 2018.
DateDiff("hour", [Ticket Date], Now()) = 103
