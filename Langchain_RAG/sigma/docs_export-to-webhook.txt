Export to webhook
Suggest Edits
ðŸ“˜
This feature does not currently support export to authenticated endpoints.
Sigma webhook exports let you send data to your own webhook endpoints, or to other applications such as Marketo, Segment, or Airtable, using a webhook. You can export your workbook data on an as-needed basis or create one or more schedules for recurring exports. Each schedule can support multiple endpoints and send conditions.
Sigma generates exports from the workbook's latest published version. You can also choose to export a tagged workbook version. Draft changes are not exported.
Requirements
The ability to export to webhooks requires the following:
You must be assigned an account type with the Export to webhook permission enabled.
You must be the workbook owner or be granted Can explore or Can edit workbook permission.

If your organization restricts traffic from certain IP addresses, add the Sigma IP addresses to your allowlist. For more details, see Add Sigma IPs to the allowlist.
Supported formats
The following file types are available for all webhook exports:
CSV
JSON
