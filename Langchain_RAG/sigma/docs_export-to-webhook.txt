Export to webhook
Suggest Edits
ðŸ“˜
This feature does not currently support export to authenticated endpoints.
Sigma webhook exports let you send data to your own webhook endpoints, or to other applications such as Marketo, Segment, or Airtable, using a webhook. You can export your workbook data on an as-needed basis or create one or more schedules for recurring exports. Each schedule can support multiple endpoints and send conditions.
Sigma generates exports from the workbook's latest published version. You can also choose to export a tagged workbook version. Draft changes are not exported.
