Popular Features
Input Tables
Sigma allows you to create, edit, and reference data from external sources like spreadsheets, databases, etc. But the data itself is stored in the cloud data warehouse, not locally. This ensures that everyone is always working with the latest, most up-to-date information.
Live Edit
Allows teams to collaborate on workbook drafts in real-time, with all editors sharing one live draft and seeing each other's changes before publishing.
Lookups
Lookups return all rows from the current data along with matching rows from the joined data, without adding any new rows. If multiple matches are found, Sigma displays a * to indicate more than one match. Lookups function similarly to VLOOKUP in Excel.
Conditional Alerts
Schedule exports as conditional alerts, only sending when data availability or values in elements meet defined conditions.
Pivot Tables
Pivot tables allow summarizing and analyzing data by plotting columns into row, column, and value fields. Required fields are pivot rows (1+ columns), pivot columns (1+ columns), and values (1+ columns). Optional fields include filters, column formatting, conditional formatting, calculated columns, collapsing/expanding groups, swapping rows/columns, and structuring value hierarchy. Pivot tables can be maximized to view underlying data.

Input Tables
Sigma allows you to create, edit, and reference data from external sources like spreadsheets, databases, etc. But the data itself is stored in the cloud data warehouse, not locally. This ensures that everyone is always working with the latest, most up-to-date information.
Joins in Datasets
When creating joins between data warehouse tables or datasets, you can add formulas to the join input columns to modify the data and ensure proper joining. This allows using scalar formulas, type conversions, conditional statements etc. on the join keys.
Joins in Workbooks
Joins in Sigma workbooks allow combining data from multiple sources like tables, datasets, or other workbook elements based on matching columns. You can select the join type, join keys, preview output, and include additional data sources in the join.
Linked Input tables

The key benefit is that any changes made to the original source data are automatically reflected in the Sigma instance, keeping everything synchronized.
Lookups
Lookups return all rows from the current data along with matching rows from the joined data, without adding any new rows. If multiple matches are found, Sigma displays a * to indicate more than one match. Lookups function similarly to VLOOKUP in Excel.

Containers allow you to organize and visually group elements on your workbook pages. This feature simplifies layout management and enables styling multiple elements together. By adding containers, you can easily control the presentation and arrangement of elements on the canvas, making it more efficient to manage complex workbooks.
Data Models
A data model is a type of Sigma document that provides a framework for creating and managing a collection of reusable elements like tables and input tables. It consists of an overview page for previewing elements and a workbook page for creating/transforming elements. Data models offer centralized permissions, efficient data handling, and flexible reusability across the organization.
Hierarchies
Hierarchies allow grouping columns categorically and defining the order of data granularity within tables, pivot tables, and visualizations in Sigma workbooks. Common examples include product hierarchies, location hierarchies, time hierarchies, and taxonomies. Hierarchies can be created, managed, reordered, and applied to pivot tables for better organization and analysis of hierarchical data.

Any column in a Sigma table can be used to define a grouping by dragging and dropping it into the "Groupings" section. This allows analyzing rows based on shared values within that column, which becomes the "grouping key". Rows are then bundled into groups based on unique values in the key column.
Hidden Controls
Create controls that are not visible on the workbook canvas but still function to filter or modify data behind the scenes based on predefined values.
Hyperlinks in Columns
Hyperlinks can be added to any column in tables or pivot tables from the column menu under "Transform > Set link".
