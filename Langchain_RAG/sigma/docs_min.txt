Min
Suggest Edits
The Min function finds the minimum value for a column or group.
To find the minimum value across columns, use the Least function.
Usage
Min([column])
Function arguments:
[column] (required) The column to be searched. Can be of type Number, Date, and String.
📘
The minimum of strings is determined by sort order, which is affected by your database settings. Sort order is most often blank spaces > special characters > numbers > uppercase letters > lowercase letters.
For numbers, preceding and trailing zeroes most often have no effect on sort order.
Example
Min([Balance])
Finds the smallest balance. Could be negative.
Min([Name])
Finds the first name alphabetically. If Name was “Betty”, “Charles”, and “Anne”, the result would be ”Anne”.
Min([Invoice Date])
Finds the lowest Invoice Date, which is the invoice date furthest in the past.
