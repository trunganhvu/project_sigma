License and account type overview
Suggest Edits
Sigma’s licensing model includes three tiers that define the usage terms of your organization members: Lite, Essential, and Pro. Each license tier establishes a different set of available permissions that enable access to Sigma’s features and capabilities. These permissions are managed at a granular level using account types. For information about using account types, see Create and manage account types.
License tiers
The three license tiers provide different levels of service to accommodate your organization’s diverse user requirements and access control policies.
Lite license
The Lite license is suitable for report consumers who require access to prepared data and insights. This license tier allows members to view shared datasets, explorations, and workbooks. Lite-licensed members also have access to baseline interactions in explorations and workbooks, including the ability to update control values, sort column data, view aggregated underlying data, and create bookmarks.
Essential license
The Essential license is ideal for decision-making data consumers who require more deep-dive capabilities in published workbooks but don’t need to build workbooks themselves. This license tier includes all Lite license capabilities while also allowing members to drill into unaggregated underlying data, contribute to input tables, download workbook content, and schedule exports and alerts.
Pro license
The Pro license is designed for data architects, BI analysts, and report builders who model, transform, and analyze data. This license tier offers the full range of Sigma features and capabilities, including the ability to create and manage datasets, data models, and workbooks. The Pro license also supports system administrators who manage organization settings and members.
Account types
While license tiers establish the maximum range of available permissions that enable access to features and capabilities, account types determine the actual permissions and access your organization members are granted. Sigma provides four default account types (Admin, Pro, Essential, and Lite) and supports custom account types that enable or disable any combination of permissions within the constraints of the license tiers.
Sigma’s customizable account types add flexibility and scalability to the access control model by enabling your organization to manage license permissions at a granular level. This allows your organization to easily modify member access and adapt to the changes in your licensed user base and user requirements.
