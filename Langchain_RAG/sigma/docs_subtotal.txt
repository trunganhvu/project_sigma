This function is not available for use in datasets.
Syntax
Subtotal(aggregate, mode, [parameters])
Function arguments:
aggregate (required) - The aggregate formula to use
mode (required) - The mode to use when calculating the aggregate formula. Mode determines which dimension(s) to use when performing the calculation.
General purpose modes
"grand_total" (default for visualizations and pivot tables) - Calculates the subtotal for the
aggregate formula.
Visualization modes
"color" - Calculates the aggregate formula using only the column specified for COLOR.
"x_axis" - Calculates the aggregate formula using only the column(s) placed on the X-AXIS.
"trellis_column" / "trellis_row" - Calculates the aggregate subtotal using only the dimension
specified for the TRELLIS COLUMN or TRELLIS ROW.
Pivot table modes
"column" / "row" - Calculates aggregate subtotal for the column or row total.
"column_parent" / "row_parent" - Calculates the aggregate subtotal for the column or row total,
relative to the subtotal calculation for the parent dimensions.
Table modes
"parent_grouping" - Calculates the aggregate formula using the grouping keys from a parent
grouping. This is equivalent to creating the aggregate calculation in a parent grouping and referencing it from a column in a lower grouping.
parameters (optional) - An additional parameter specific to the mode.
This is only applicable to the following modes: "column_parent", "row_parent" and "parent_grouping".  For these modes, this 3rd parameter specifies how many parent dimensions to ignore.
Examples
Subtotal(Avg([Price]), "column")
Calculates the aggregate subtotal for each column of the Product Type dimension.
Verify that the calculation values match the built-in pivot subtotals at the bottom of the table.
Subtotal(CountDistinct([Product Type]), "x_axis")
Calculates the aggregate subtotal for each Product Type, across all values of Store Region.
The calculation is shown in the tooltip, but is usable anywhere an aggregate formula is allowed.
