If the data source of your data element in a workbook is a data model table with one or more relationships , you can add columns from the related tables to your data element. Any child elements that you create can also access the related columns.

In the editor panel, for columns, select + (Add columns...).
In the menu, choose Add source columns....

If([TRIP/Start Station Details/Dock Count] > 15, "high availability", [TRIP/Start Station Details/Dock Count] = 15, "medium availability", [TRIP/Start Station Details/Dock Count] < 15, "low availability")
The resulting table includes the calculated column, named Start Station Dock Availability:
