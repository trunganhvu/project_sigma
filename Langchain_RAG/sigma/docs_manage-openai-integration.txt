ðŸš©
This documentation describes a public beta feature and is under construction. This documentation should not be considered part of our published documentation until this notice, and the corresponding Beta flag on the feature in the Sigma service, are removed. As with any beta feature, the feature discussed below is subject to quick, iterative changes. The latest experience in the Sigma service might differ from the contents of this document.
Beta features are subject to the Beta features disclaimer.
The OpenAI integration allows users of the Sigma Service to access and use OpenAI language models (including GPT-4 and embedding models) for features like visualization explanations and the formula assistant.1 You can integrate with OpenAI directly or through Azure OpenAI Service.

The use of AI features is subject to the following disclaimer.
User requirements
The ability to configure the OpenAI integration in Sigma requires the following:
You must be assigned the Admin account type.
You must be able to provide the required authentication credentials.
Prerequisites
Before configuring the OpenAI integration, retrieve the authentication credentials from OpenAI or Azure, depending on your chosen integration method (direct or through Azure OpenAI Service).
OpenAI credentials (direct)
To integrate with OpenAI directly, your company must obtain, manage, and secure an OpenAI API key. You can retrieve the API key in the API keys section of the OpenAI developer platform.
For more information about your API key, see Best Practices for API Key Safety in the OpenAI documentation.
Azure OpenAI credentials
To integrate with OpenAI through Azure OpenAI Service, your company must have an Azure subscription with access to Azure OpenAI. For each language model, you must also provide the endpoint URL, model deployment name, and API key, which you can retrieve from your Azure portal or Azure OpenAI Studio (see the following table for guidance).
Sigma credential Azure location
Endpoint URL In the Azure portal, open the applicable resource page, then go to Resource Management > Keys and Endpoint and copy the URL in the Endpoint field.

You can also find this value in Azure OpenAI Studio > Playground > Code View.
Deployment ID
(model deployment name) In the Azure portal, open the applicable resource page, then go to Resource Management > Deployments and copy the model deployment name. This must be gpt-4-turbo or later (for a GPT-4 model) or text-embedding-3-small (for an Embeddings model).

You can also find this value in Azure OpenAI Studio > Management > Deployments.
API Key In the Azure portal, open the applicable resource page, then go to Resource Management > Keys and Endpoint and copy the value in the KEY1 or KEY2 field.
Add the OpenAI integration
If youâ€™ve retrieved the required credentials, you can quickly authenticate the OpenAI integration to enable AI functionality in Sigma. Refer to one of the following sections based on your chosen integration method.
