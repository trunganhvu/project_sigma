How Kipi.ai Transformed Their BI Strategy with Sigma
By Naveen Mithare
SENIOR SOLUTION ARCHITECT, KIPI.AI
We spoke with Naveen Mithare, Senior Solution Architect at Kipi.ai, an elite Snowflake partner specializing in BI advisory and implementation solutions. Despite their success in delivering advanced data strategies, Kipi.ai faced challenges in providing real-time, scalable analytics for their clients. Seeking a solution that could integrate seamlessly with Snowflake and enhance their data product offerings, they turned to Sigma. The result was a transformative shift in how Kipi.ai delivers data-driven insights, enabling their team to build powerful, monetizable data applications with real-time capabilities and improved client engagement.
Life Before Sigma
Before we adopted Sigma at Kipi.ai, our approach to data analysis was fragmented. We relied heavily on traditional BI tools, which often required significant manual effort to extract data insights. With these tools, we constantly faced challenges around scalability and real-time data integration. We’re an elite Snowflake partner, and working within the cloud-native environment, we needed a BI solution that could keep up with the speed and complexity of our data workloads.
Our clients expected fast, data-driven insights, and many of the tools we were using lacked the depth of integration we needed. 
This limitation made it harder to provide the real-time, actionable intelligence that many of our clients demanded. In short, our existing BI solutions were falling behind in the fast-paced, data-intensive environment we were operating in.
Choosing a BI Solution
When we set out to find a better solution, we knew we needed something cloud-native that could seamlessly integrate with Snowflake to support our BI advisory needs and enhance our data product offerings. As a Snowflake Elite Partner, we explored several BI tools on the market, each with unique capabilities we’ve implemented in various client solutions. However, Sigma stood out as the ideal solution for its robust data modeling, real-time data access directly from Snowflake, and its intuitive, flexible interface.
With Sigma, we could empower team members and clients alike with live, actionable insights, without needing to move data out of the warehouse. Its powerful embedding capabilities made it possible for us to build collaborative, scalable analytics environments that meet the diverse needs of technical and non-technical users. Sigma has become an essential part of our toolkit, allowing us to deliver impactful, data-driven solutions more efficiently.
Life With Sigma
Since adopting Sigma, the impact has been transformative. One of our flagship achievements has been creating data products with embedded analytics solutions powered by Sigma. For instance, I led the development of a Customer Acquisition Platform for iGaming brands using Sigma’s dashboards and embedding features. This project resulted in a powerful, monetizable data application that brought significant value to one of our top clients.
We developed several Sigma Quick Start packages, such as the Sigma Onboarding, Migration to Sigma, and Sigma Embedding packages. These have not only streamlined our internal go-to-market strategies but also enabled us to demonstrate Sigma’s value to prospective clients much faster, reducing our onboarding time by 30 percent. These packages have been instrumental in attracting new clients, significantly expanding our client base and strengthening our market presence.
Sigma has become a growth engine for us. 
With its ability to create real-time data solutions directly from Snowflake, we’ve positioned ourselves as leaders in the BI and analytics space. We’ve also launched the Sigma Thrive program, which has enhanced client satisfaction and retention, positioning Kipi.ai as a trusted partner in BI advisory.
What's Next with Sigma
Looking ahead, Sigma plays a central role in our BI strategy. We’re focused on expanding our Sigma capabilities, especially in embedded analytics and real-time data applications. We are currently working on several large-scale projects, and Sigma’s role in these initiatives will be pivotal.
One of our key goals is to expand the use of Sigma in creating sophisticated data products that can be monetized and further enhance client value. Additionally, our team is actively refining our Sigma Training Plan, which has already helped certify over 15 team members at the intermediate level or higher. This is essential to ensure that our team remains at the cutting edge of BI innovation.
Ultimately, Sigma is helping us drive success not only for our clients but also for Kipi.ai as a whole, and we are excited to see where this partnership takes us next.
