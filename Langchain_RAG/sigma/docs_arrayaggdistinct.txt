Syntax
ArrayAggDistinct(value, [direction])
Function arguments:
value (required) The column containing values to join.
direction (optional) The directional order to sort the column values.
“asc” sorts values in ascending order.
“desc” sorts values in descending order.
When a direction isn’t specified, Sigma sorts values in the same order as the column referenced in the value argument. If the referenced column isn’t sorted, Sigma sorts values in ascending order by default.
Example
ArrayAggDistinct([Product Type], “asc”)
For each grouping (grouped by order number) the ArrayAggDistinct function returns an array containing distinct non-null values—sorted in ascending order—from the corresponding rows in the Product Type column.
