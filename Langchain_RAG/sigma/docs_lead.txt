Lead
Suggest Edits
The Lead function accesses data in subsequent rows in the same result set, without having to join the table to itself. It references the column and returns its values in the offset position, shifting the output up by a fixed number of rows.
The Lead function typically shifts values up, while the Lag function shifts values down.

These are the function arguments:

Lead([Attendance], 1)
A table lists the total attendance for each game of an MLB team's 2021 season. You can use the Lead function to compare this value with the number of attendees recorded for the next game.
The formula references the Attendance column and shifts its values up one row. The resulting output in each row of the Next Game column indicates the number of people who attended the game that occurred immediately after the one referenced in the Game Key column.
