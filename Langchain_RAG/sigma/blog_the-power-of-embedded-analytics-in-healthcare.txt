The Power of Embedded Analytics in Healthcare
Healthcare's use of predictive analytics
“Big data” is often defined by the volume, variety, and velocity of new data. As big data continues to proliferate, many businesses struggle to keep up. This is especially true in the healthcare sector where HIPPA and GDPR compliance is paramount. Digital innovation and the use of advanced analytics will significantly influence healthcare in the future by helping to wrangle this data and produce meaningful insights. The healthcare sector has a lot to gain from the adoption of embedded analytics solutions since it has access to the most rapidly growing volumes of data collected from patient care and physician performance. 
Medical and healthcare software providers are in a great position to contribute to a revolution in healthcare analytics that will empower healthcare professionals, significantly improve the standard of patient care, and offer opportunities to monetize enormous amounts of unwieldy data that a powerful solution like Sigma has transformed into actionable insights with drill-down capabilities for true self-service.
Sigma provides the convenience of a spreadsheet interface and simple access to data without requiring knowledge of programming languages. The power of Sigma can be brought directly in front of healthcare professionals in the software that they already use daily. 
So, what exactly is embedded analytics?
Embedded Analytics is the practice of embedding business intelligence and data visualization capabilities into an existing software application. Sigma’s embedded analytics enables customers to discover actionable insights in their data by integrating reports and dashboards into existing software applications. While traditional software development can be time-consuming, Sigma’s embedded analytics streamline the process of building a better user experience with data, saving critical development time and resources.
Healthcare: The Power of Sigma Embedded Analytics 
Happy patients
Improving patient outcomes is one of the main goals of a healthcare provider. A healthcare facility can improve patient satisfaction by providing all records, prescriptions, and recommendations consistently in one application. Healthcare providers can improve patient experiences by using Sigma to speed up critical care response times, particularly in emergency situations, service quality, environment cleanliness monitoring, the availability of medical equipment, health condition monitoring, and much more. 
Today, Moffitt Cancer Center is leveraging Sigma in conjunction with its Snowflake data warehouse to solve its two key analytics use cases in a flexible, easy, secure, and resource efficient manner.
Calculation of Human Error
Human error is a serious threat in the medical field. Sigma makes it easier to access and evaluate data in real-time. Embedded healthcare analytics can aid clinicians in identifying possible problems and preventing mishaps. Healthcare institutions are prone to errors from  appointment processing or scheduling, time allocation for various exam processes, doctor allocation in a system, record handling, correct equipment maintenance, and much more. Sigma can address these issues by allowing institutions to schedule conditional alerts based on several parameters that can find and flag a human error through Sigma’s schedule exports functionality.
Monitoring medical records
By monitoring practical KPIs and indicators, Sigma enables healthcare professionals to minimize unforeseen difficulties during emergencies, capture trends, and utilize resources as effectively as possible. Sigma’s cutting-edge predictive analytics enables healthcare practitioners to deliver a more individualized approach to therapy, particularly for at-risk patients.
Reduced Operations Cost
Identifying wasteful hospital spending patterns through the tracking of all prior expenses can lower patient costs by enabling the adoption of cost-cutting initiatives on a broad scale. With the right data analysis, costs such as these hospital expenses, historical insurance coverage for various treatments and medications, ordered vs utilized supplies, and pricing changes for supplies from various vendors can all be refined and optimized. 
Input Tables 
Healthcare teams can effortlessly incorporate human context into their analysis by bringing their own data directly into the warehouse using Sigma's Input Tables, all without writing any code. Teams working in analytics and healthcare can remove data roadblocks, reduce repetitive analytics tasks, and make more impactful decisions faster.
Data Security & Privacy
Sigma maintains the highest levels of data security and privacy when integrating analytical tools into healthcare-specific applications. Sigma sits atop your existing cloud database and uses a secure connection to query your data warehouse directly, answering questions and returning results in the browser. 
Sigma provides a single point of access for your data, so you can establish robust data governance, keep report sprawl to a minimum, and restrict access to sensitive information. Administrators can set permissions by team and namespace, and restrict data access directly from the database as well.
We built Sigma with security in mind, which is why we included features like immutable hosts, container checking, and threat detection. At Sigma, we make every effort to provide secure data analytics and ensure our platform is protected at every layer of the stack.
