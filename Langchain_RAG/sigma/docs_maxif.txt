The MaxIf function finds the maximum value for a column or group if the conditions are true.
Syntax
MaxIf(field, condition)
Function arguments:
field (required) - The column to be searched. Can be of type Number, Date, and String.
condition (required) - The condition to test. If the condition is True, then the row will be factored into the aggregate.  You can use operators in conditions.
ðŸ“˜
The maximum of strings is determined by sort order, which is affected by your database settings. Sort order is most often blank spaces > special characters > numbers > uppercase letters > lowercase letters.
For numbers, preceding and trailing zeroes most often have no effect on sort order.
Examples
MaxIf([Invoice Date], [State] = "TX")
Finds the greatest Invoice Date for all entries where the State indicated is Texas.
MaxIf([Sales], [Region] = "East" AND [Status] = "Complete")
Finds the maximum Sale value for entries in the "East" Region that are marked as "Complete".
