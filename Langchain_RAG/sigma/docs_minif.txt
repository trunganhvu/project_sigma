The MinIf function finds the minimum value for a column or group if the conditions are true.
Syntax
MinIf(field, condition)
Function arguments:
field (required) - The column to be searched. Can be of type Number, Date, and String.
condition (required) - The condition to test. If the condition is True, then the row will be factored into the aggregate.  You can use operators in conditions.
ðŸ“˜
The minimum of strings is determined by sort order, which is affected by your database settings. Sort order is most often blank spaces > special characters > numbers > uppercase letters > lowercase letters.
For numbers, preceding and trailing zeroes most often have no effect on sort order.
Examples

Finds the earliest Invoice Date of all entries where the State indicated is Texas.
MinIf([Sales], [Region] = "East" AND [Status] = "Complete")
Finds the minimum Sale value for entries in the "East" Region that are marked as "Complete".
