Create and manage account types
Suggest Edits
Account types enable you to manage member access to specific features and capabilities available through each license tier. Default and custom account types add flexibility and scalability to Sigmaâ€™s access control methodology, allowing your organization to adapt to ongoing changes in your licensed user base and user requirements.
This document introduces default and custom account types and explains how to create, manage, and assign account types to organization members. For more information about account types as they relate to the licensing model, see License and account type overview.
User requirements
To create and manage account types and member assignments, you must be assigned the Admin account type.
Default and custom account types
Sigma supports default and custom account types that allow you to enable or disable any combination of permissions within the constraints of your organizationâ€™s license tiers.
For a comparison of available account type permissions by tier, see Account type permission availability matrix.
Default account types
There are four default account types built into your organization: Lite, Essential, Pro, and Admin. These account types reflect Sigma's license tiers and support four standard roles or levels of access.
Default account type Description
Lite
(Lite license)
Enables all permissions available through the Lite license tier.
Recommended for members who require access to prepared data and insights.
Essential
(Essential license)
Enables all permissions available through the Essential license tier.
Recommended for members who require more deep-dive capabilities in published workbooks but donâ€™t need to build workbooks themselves.
Pro
(Pro license)
Enables a selection of permissions available through the Pro license tier.
Recommended for members who model, transform, and analyze data.
Admin
(Pro license)
Enables all permissions available through the Pro license tier and administrative privileges.
Recommended for system administrators who manage organization settings and members.
Custom account types
Custom account types allow you to create additional roles and variations of access within any license tier. You can enable or disable individual permissions for granular access control that suits any member of your organization.
