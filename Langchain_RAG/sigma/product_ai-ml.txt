Your UI for AI at the enterprise
Sigma unites your team, your data, and your AI strategy in one governed platform.
FAST
Apply AI models to your data in seconds
Write a simple SQL function in Sigma to call an AI model from your cloud data warehouse and run it on data columns.
STRUCTURED
Work in the tool that structures AI for you
Sigma’s spreadsheet UI calls AI models into columns and returns the output into rows. This familiar format makes it easier and faster to work with AI.
FLYWHEEL
Train AI models with business user input
Anyone—with appropriate permissions—can apply AI models to data, use Input Tables to correct the AI-generated outputs, and then securely write these corrections back to the warehouse, which trains the AI model continuously on live user feedback.
The most accessible way to get started with AI
Take advantage of the newest Gen AI functionality like summarization, classification, and open-ended prompting directly in Sigma’s formula bar. As long as your cloud warehouse exposes LLMs through a SQL function, you can call on them directly in Sigma.
