Suggest Edits
Sigma's CSV Upload feature allows your team to upload and analyze CSV data in Sigma. This feature stores a copy of the CSV directly in your data warehouse. As such, it must be enabled on both your organization and individual warehouse connection by an organization admin.
Requirements
Sigma Admin privileges are required to enable this feature; see Account types.
A connection with write access enabled.
Where's my data stored?
When a CSV file is uploaded to Sigma, its data is automatically written back to your data warehouse as a new warehouse table. If your organization has multiple warehouses with write access enabled, you will be given the option to select a single destination.
CSV data stored in your warehouse is only accessible through through the document in which it is used. You will not see it listed as a warehouse table in the connection. 
Note: When write access is enabled on a connection schema, the schema is hidden from the Sigma connection panel. Instead of a list of tables, you will see a note that declaring "No Accessible Data". The schema and its tables will remain available in your data warehouse.
Enable CSV Upload
Open your Admin Portal.
On the Account page, find the section titled Features.
Click the toggle switch next to CSV Upload.
Note: This will automatically enable CSV upload for any connections with write access enabled.
Before your team can upload CSVs, you must also enable write access on the connection(s) you wish to use for this feature. See Write access.
