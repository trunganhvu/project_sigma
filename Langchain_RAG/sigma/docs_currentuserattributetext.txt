Suggest Edits
The CurrentUserAttributeText function returns the corresponding attribute value for the current user as a Text data type.
Syntax
CurrentUserAttributeText("attrName")
attrName
Required
Name of the user attribute generated in the User Attribute section of the Admin portal.
Returns the current user's corresponding attribute value.
The argument must be a Text data type.
Example
An admin adds a text column named Region into a dataset, creates a user attribute called Region Attribute, and assigns the user attribute to the following teams:
West Team (consisting of users 1 and 2)
Midwest Team (consisting of users 3 and 4)
When using the following function in a dataset, members of each team will only see the rows that match the corresponding user attribute value in the Region column. That is, users 1 and 2 can see rows with the West Region value, and users 3 and 4 can see rows with the Midwest Region value.
CurrentUserAttributeText(“Region Attribute”) = [Region]
