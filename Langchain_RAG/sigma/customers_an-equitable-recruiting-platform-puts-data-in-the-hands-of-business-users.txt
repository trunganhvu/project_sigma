An equitable recruiting platform puts data in the hands of business users
By Lia Schiza
VICE PRESIDENT OF ENGINEERING, POWERTOFLY
Today’s customer story is written by Lia Schiza, Vice President of Engineering at PowerToFly. PowerToFly is a recruiting and retention platform that connects unrepresented talent with employers. 
Life Before Sigma
At PowerToFly, our goal is to make Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE&I) part of the entire recruiting process. We make sure DEI is front and center from the moment you attract talent to engagement after they’ve joined. With our recruiting platform, the idea is to show employers what types of talent they are attracting and allow them to compare their efforts to other organizations. 
This data helps employers better understand their DE&I needs, attract the right talent to their organization, and engage with the talent they attract with personalized recruiting tools. 
At the same time, talent also wants to know an organization's DE&I initiatives, which requires data. We use data to help candidates upskill and be ready for the jobs they want to get. Data is a huge part of our platform and our commitment to DE&I.
We were actually able in a matter of one week to stand up four of our big product dashboard.
We were using another product before Sigma, but the biggest challenge we had was that internal users at PowerToFly could not actually deduce their own analytics. They always relied on our data engineering team to be able to generate the insights for them. 
Choosing Sigma
When we were evaluating analytics platforms, we had several criteria. The first was a platform where we could optimize cost — as we sell analytics for our end users into our embedded platform. The other was to enable internal users to deduce their own insights without relying on our data platform or the engineering team. The third was the ability to provide a variety of insights, charts, and mechanics, such as forecasting and benchmarking, so we can provide intelligent insights to our customers. Through our proof of concept for Sigma, we were actually able in a matter of one week to stand up four of our big product dashboards. In the past, when we first engaged with a different data analytics provider, it took us almost a month to stand things up.
We all stopped being afraid of looking at data analytics, because it no longer required an engineer.
Life with Sigma
We are using Sigma in two ways. First, internally, we use Sigma for financial forecasting and revenue operations. A lot of it used to be under Google Analytics, making it so hard to work with. All of that is being migrated now to Sigma so that the RevOps team that is not technical can be enabled! 
Since implementing Sigma, we got better work-life balance because not everything was coming into a single team. 
Second, we have embedded analytics for our recruiting platform. This tells the recruiter the entire story of engaging with a high-potential candidate, in addition to providing demographics across industries and sectors so they can understand their health. In terms of diversity, we also track all engagement analytics of the talent experience on powertofly.com.
Since we integrated with Sigma, not only have we provided value to our customers, but some other wonderful things have happened inside the team. First of all, we all stopped being afraid of looking at data analytics, because it no longer required an engineer to deduce analytics. 
We also got better work-life balance because not everything was coming into a single team. People got the autonomy to do what they needed to do instead of waiting and putting pressure on a single team to deliver for them. We all started feeling comfortable building insights and sharing them.
We are saving weeks of engineering work as we are not relying on a single person.
We went from one person understanding the data to business stakeholders rolling up their sleeves and digging in. All of a sudden stakeholders were empowered to understand the data. We are now saving weeks of engineering work because we are not relying on a single person and non-techie folks can roll up their sleeves in Sigma and visualize to their heart's content. 
Future With Sigma
Sigma will continue to be critical for our products, our embedded solutions, and our internal users. One of our use cases is for more sophisticated users who want to create their own insights — separately from the already provided dashboards we embed into the products. 
Sigma will also enable us to provide that functionality to users internally and, of course, for our internal revenue operations. For our operations team, Sigma will continue to be important so we can deduce the business insights that we need.
