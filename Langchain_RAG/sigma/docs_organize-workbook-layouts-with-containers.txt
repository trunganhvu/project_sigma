Organize workbook layouts with containers
Suggest Edits
Add containers to your workbook pages to organize elements on the canvas and visually group elements together. With containers, you can more easily manage layouts and style elements as a group.
Prerequisites
You must be the owner or have Can Edit or Can Explore permissions on the workbook.
Add a container to a workbook
You can add an empty container or add a container around existing elements:
Add an empty container
Add a container around existing elements
Add an empty container
Select Add element…, then in the Containers section, select a container and drag it onto the workbook canvas.
Select Add element…, then drag elements into the container.
Add a container around existing elements
To add a container around existing elements, drag or ctrl/cmd+click to select multiple elements, then click Create container () or press ctrl/cmd+g.
The container is created on the canvas and selected by default.
Move a container
To change the location of a container and its elements, select the edge of the container to select the container, then drag the container to the new location.
Resize a container
You can drag the edges of a container to resize it. When you resize a container, the grid size inside the container changes and the elements inside the container are resized to fit.
Resizing a container horizontally does not remove empty space inside the container. You cannot resize a container smaller than the elements inside of it.
Style a container
Select Element properties to style your container:
Style Details
Padding Adds padding to the container. Selected by default. Deselect the checkbox to remove padding between elements and the container.
Background color Select a background color for the container.
Border Specify a border for the container. Defaults to none, but can be set to 1, 2, or 3 pixels. You can also choose a color for the border.
Corner Choose a corner shape for the container. Choose between square, round, and pill. Defaults to round.
Element gap Adds padding between elements in the container. Selected by default. Deselect the checkbox to remove padding between elements.
Remove or delete a container
To remove a container around elements, select the enclosing container, then select More > Remove container. The container is removed and any elements inside the container are placed on the canvas. Elements keep the same formatting.
You can also delete a container and all elements inside the container. To do so, select the enclosing container, then select More > Delete container. The container and all elements inside are deleted.
