PercentileCont
Suggest Edits
The PercentileCont function calculates the continuous kth percentile value for a column or group. It returns the percent of the total frequency under that number, demonstrating the relative position of the value compared to the entire set of data. You can use the PercentileCont function on BigQuery, PostgreSQL, Databricks, Snowflake, Redshift, MySQL, and AlloyDB connections.
Syntax
PercentileCont(column, k)
The function has the following arguments:
column
Required
The column to search.
k
Required
A number between 0 and 1, which corresponds to the percent of data below that number.
0 < k < 1
Example
A Score column contains values 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10.
PercentileCont([Score], 0.7)
The continuous 70th percentile of the Score column is 7.6. If a candidate scores in the 70th percentile, they have scored higher than 70% of test takers, putting them in the top 30%.
