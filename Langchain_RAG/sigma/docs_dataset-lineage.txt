On the lineage tab of warehouse tables and datasets, you can see everywhere your dataset or warehouse table is being used in Sigma, and all of the sources your dataset relies on. This lets you see what will be affected when you make changes to a given dataset or warehouse table.
Data sources are shown on datasets. It lists the warehouse tables and datasets that are directly used as sources of data by your dataset.
References are shown on both tables and datasets. This tab shows all of the Sigma documents that directly reference the table or dataset you are viewing.
