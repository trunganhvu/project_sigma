Requirements
To use this feature, you must have Can Edit or Can Explore access to the individual workbook.
Change the position of the chart axis
After adding at least one column to the y-axis (for vertical charts) or the x-axis (for horizontal charts), you can change the position of the axis.
Before you start: This action uses the editor panel. If you have not done so already, open the editor panel from either Explore or Edit mode; see Workbook modes.
In the editor panel, hover over the y-axis column name, then click the caret () to open the column menu.
For Axis, select the image that shows the axis in the position that you want.

The chart updates with the axis in the new position.
Add a second chart axis
For charts that visualize at least two columns on the y-axis (for vertical charts) or the x-axis (for horizontal charts), you can add a second chart axis.
Before you start: This action uses the editor panel. If you have not done so already, open the editor panel from either Explore or Edit mode; see Workbook modes.
In the editor panel, hover over the y-axis column name, then click the caret () to open the column menu.
For Axis, select the image that shows the axis in the position that you want.

The chart updates to show a second y-axis.
