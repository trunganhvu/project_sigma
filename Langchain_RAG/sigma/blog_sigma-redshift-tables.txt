Unlock More Data Flexibility With Sigma’s Expanded Support For Input Tables In Amazon Redshift
DECEMBER 2, 2024
Sigma’s Input Tables are now available for Amazon Redshift, giving you the flexibility to create, manage, and analyze data seamlessly within your Redshift environment. With Input Tables, you can write back directly to Redshift — unlocking dynamic workflows like prototyping, forecasting, and blending external datasets — all without leaving Sigma. This integration puts you in control, making agile, collaborative analytics easier than ever.
What are Input Tables?
Input Tables are dynamic workbook elements that let you input, modify, and manage data directly in Sigma. They’re perfect for rapid prototyping, advanced modeling, and scenario planning, all without altering your underlying data.
How this transforms your workflows
Your valuable data often lives outside of the data warehouse. With Sigma’s expanded support for Input Tables in Redshift, you can now incorporate external data — from spreadsheets and CSVs to ad hoc business inputs — directly into your Redshift-powered Sigma environment. No more workarounds or delays. Simply upload, create a table, and input data in the Sigma UI. 
Key benefits of Redshift Input Tables in Sigma
1. Effortless data blending
Combine your warehouse data with Input Tables for a unified view of your business. From quick analyses to strategic reporting, blending Input Tables with Redshift data means faster, more holistic insights.
2. Increased data agility 
Add new datasets on the fly without database integration or engineering support. Perfect for teams that work with frequently changing data or want to perform rapid, exploratory analyses.
3. Centralized governance & security
Sigma’s user permissions extend to Redshift Input Tables, ensuring only authorized users can access, modify, or add data. Knowing that your data remains secure provides flexibility and peace of mind.
4. Streamlined reporting & collaboration
Once in Sigma, Input Tables are instantly available for use in reports, dashboards, and collaborative worksheets. Teams can explore, analyze, and share insights across the organization, leveraging the power of both structured warehouse data and ad hoc Input Tables.
5. Customized data applications
Build fully-fledged data applications tailored precisely to your business needs. This integration enables decentralized data collection, allowing you to build flexible data collection processes across your entire organization.
