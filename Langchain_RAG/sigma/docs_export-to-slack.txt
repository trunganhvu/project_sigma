Export to Slack
Suggest Edits
If Slack notifications are enabled for your organization, workbooks, their pages, and individual elements can be sent to any channel in your Slack account on a set schedule or as-needed basis.
For example, you might want to provide a weekly uptime report to your management team, but your team communicates primarily in Slack. You can set up an export to a Slack channel or a specific user to make sure your management sees the report.
You can set multiple export schedules for a workbook. Slack exports capture data accessible to the user who initiated the export.
Sigma generates exports from the workbook's latest published version. You can also choose to export a tagged version of the workbook. Depending on the file format you choose, you can also export a bookmark. Changes you make to a workbook draft or exploration cannot be exported unless you publish the changes. For a matrix of supported file formats, see Available export destinations and formats.
This documentation describes how to send and schedule exports to Slack.
