Export to Slack
Suggest Edits
If Slack notifications are enabled for your organization, workbooks, their pages, and individual elements can be sent to any channel in your Slack account on a set schedule or as-needed basis.
For example, you might want to provide a weekly uptime report to your management team, but your team communicates primarily in Slack. You can set up an export to a Slack channel or a specific user to make sure your management sees the report.
You can set multiple export schedules for a workbook. Slack exports capture data accessible to the user who initiated the export.
Sigma generates exports from the workbook's latest published version. You can also choose to export a tagged version of the workbook. Depending on the file format you choose, you can also export a bookmark. Changes you make to a workbook draft or exploration cannot be exported unless you publish the changes. For a matrix of supported file formats, see Available export destinations and formats.
This documentation describes how to send and schedule exports to Slack.
User requirements
The ability to export to Slack requires the following:
The Slack integration must be enabled for your organization. If you want to send notifications to a private channel, you must also add Sigma to the private channel. See Adding Sigma to a private Slack channel.
You must be assigned an account type with the Export to Slack permission enabled.
You must be the workbook owner or be granted Can explore or Can edit workbook permission.
Export size limit
The size limit for exports to Slack is 1GB per file. See Download, export, and upload limitations.
Send an ad hoc notification
To export information from a workbook to Slack:
From the workbook menu , select Export.
ðŸ“˜
If the Slack option is not available, the workbook is in Edit mode. Either publish your draft or return to the latest published or tagged version of the workbook before attempting to export.
Select Slack.
In the To field, enter the name of the Slack channel, for example, #team-channel.
If you want to send the notification to a private channel, you must first add the Sigma notifications bot to the channel. Enter @Sigma in your private channel to enable it. See Adding Sigma to a private Slack channel.
(Optional) Enter a message in the Message field.
You can notify individuals by user ID. Get the Slack member ID for the user from their Slack user profile, then use the syntax <@user_id> in the message. The angle brackets are required.
You can also use Slack channel @ mentions, such as @here or @channel, to notify people in the Slack channel when the notification is delivered.
If the workbook has versions or bookmarks, select which one you want to send.
In the Attachment section, choose what you want to export as an attachment. You can export:
An Entire workbook and export all workbook pages.
A specific workbook page, by navigating to the workbook page and choosing Entire page.
