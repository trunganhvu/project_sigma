System and user requirements
The ability to explain a chart with AI requires the following:

About AI-generated explanations
When you use the Explain this chart feature, Sigma captures a snapshot of the chart and passes this image, along with the chartâ€™s underlying data, to your OpenAI model. The model then processes the information and analyzes the context to generate an explanation of the data visualized by the chart. Sigma presents this explanation and allows you to provide feedback about the results, which can be used to improve future responses.
For information about how your data is secured and stored when using AI features, see Frequently asked questions in Manage OpenAI integration.
