Basic explore vs. Full explore
Suggest Edits
Account types support two permissions (Basic explore and Full explore) that enable users to be granted Can explore access to individual workbooks. These account type permissions determine how users interact with workbooks, specifically in View and Explore mode.
Basic explore enables users to access View mode with additional interactions and lightweight customization when granted Can explore access to the workbook.
Full explore enables Basic explore capabilities in View mode and the full scope of interactions and customizations in Explore mode.
This document provides comprehensive comparisons of granular user capabilities based on account type permission (View workbooks, Basic explore, or Full explore) and workbook access (Can view or Can explore). For a complete comparison of capabilities in all workbook modes, including Edit mode, see Workbook modes overview.

The comparisons include the View workbook permission to demonstrate the workbook interactions supported when a user is assigned an account type with neither Basic explore nor Full explore permission. For more information about these account type permissions, see License and account type overview.
