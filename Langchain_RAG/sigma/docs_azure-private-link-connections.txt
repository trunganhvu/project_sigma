Azure Private Link Connections
Suggest Edits
This document explains how to connect Sigma to your data warehouse that's hosted on Azure using Azure's Private Link.  
ðŸ“˜
See Sigma's Azure Private Link lab for more information on how to establish a secure connection between Sigma and an Azure data warehouse.
Requirements
A Sigma organization running on Azure.
Admin privileges in your Sigma organization; see User account types.
Snowflake, Databricks, PostgreSQL or MySQL Admin, depending on the data warehouse.
Be an Admin in Azure.
Introduction 
Sigma organizations running on Azure can securely connect to their data using Azure's Private Link, which allows Sigma to access the data warehouse hosted on Azure via a private endpoint in the virtual network. This not only enhances security during data transit but also improves performance by reducing network latency. With Private Link, Sigma connects to the data warehouse using private IP addresses, ensuring traffic never leaves the Microsoft network and data remains secure without exposure to the internet. 
To utilize Private Link, create a private endpoint in your virtual network that maps to the data warehouse, assign it a private IP address, and connect to the warehouse using this address.
Sigma supports connections to the following data warehouses on Azure:
Snowflake
Databricks
PostgreSQL
MySQL
Create Private Link Connection for Your Data Warehouse
Follow the steps below to create a Private Link connection to your data warehouse hosted in Azure.
ðŸ“˜
To initiate this process, the first step for all data warehouses is to retrieve the required information and send to your account manager.
Snowflake 
Provide Snowflake Info to Sigma
Follow the steps below to provide Sigma with the requisite information to create a Private Link for your organization.  
ðŸ“˜
Your Snowflake account must be Business Critical Edition to use Private Link.
In the Snowflake SQL console, run the following command:
SQL
select system$get_privatelink_config();
Below is the output from the SQL query. In the example above, the output is highlighted in blue.
JSON
{"regionless-snowsight-privatelink-url":"app-br67048-sigma_azure_us_east_2.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com",
"privatelink-account-name":"os99982.east-us-2.privatelink",
"snowsight-privatelink-url":"app.east-us-2.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com",
"privatelink-account-url":"os99982.east-us-2.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com",
"privatelink-pls-id":"sf-pvlinksvc-azeastus2.cf82bce2-bw2d-4dw2-92ee-3dw2fb04d191.eastus2.azure.privatelinkservice",
"regionless-privatelink-account-url":"br67048-sigma_azure_us_east_2.snowflakecomputing.com",
"privatelink_ocsp-url":"ocsp.os99982.east-us-2.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com",
"privatelink-connection-urls":"[]"}
In the output field, copy the values for privatelink-pls-id and private-account-url. In the example above, the values are highlighted in red.
In the example above, private-pls-id is
sf-pvlinksvc-azeastus2.cf82bce2-bw2d-4dw2-92ee-3dw2fb04d191.eastus2.azure.privatelinkservice
and private-account-url is
os99982.east-us-2.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com
Send these two values to your Sigma account manager.
Sigma creates a Private Link and alert you when the link is active.
ðŸ“˜
You can't configure the connection until Sigma creates the Private Link.
Configure Snowflake Connection
Follow the steps below to configure your Sigma Snowflake connection to use Private Link.
After the private link is active, in Sigma, go to Admin > Connections > Snowflake.
Click Create to create a Snowflake connection.
In the Account field, enter the three parts of the account URL in this format: <account>.<region_id>.privatelink
For example, if the account URL is:
test123.west-us-2.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com
The Account field is test123.west-us-2.privatelink
Under Warehouse, enter your warehouseâ€™s name as listed in Snowflake.
If you have OAuth enabled on your organization, and you would like to use it on the connection, switch on OAuth access; see Connect to Snowflake with OAuth.
Please note: Steps 9 - 11 are not applicable if you choose to use OAuth without a service account.
Under User, enter your Snowflake username.
Under Password, enter your Snowflake password.
[optional] For Role, you can specify a Snowflake role to be used on this connection.
[optional] For Connection Features, you can set a connection timeout and/or enable write access.
After completing the form, click Create.
Databricks
Prerequisites
You must create an Azure Databricks workspace.
Your Databricks workspace must be Premium tier.
A customized networking configuration is required to support Private Link.
Provide Databricks Resource ID to Sigma
Follow the steps below to provide Sigma with the Resource ID to create a private link for your organization.  
In Azure Services, hover over Azure Databricks and click Create.
Click JSON View in the top-right corner of the databricks workspace page in Azure. 
On the Networking tab, you must check Yes for Deploy Azure Databricks workspace in your own Virtual Network and enter pre-configured virtual network and two subnets within the virtual network CIDR range for public and private subnet fields.
Copy the following values and send them to your Account Executive:
Resource ID
Region Name for the Databricks warehouse (under Location)
URL for the Databricks service (formatted as adb-<workspace-id>.<random-number>.azuredatabricks.net)
Private Link Approval
Follow the steps below to approve the Private Link after Sigma notifies you. 
In the Azure portal, go to Azure Databricks.
Click the selected Azure Databricks workspace.
Click Networking on the left panel.
Click on Private endpoint connections.
Select the newly created private endpoint. The status will be Pending. Check Approve to approve the endpoint. Copy the name of the private endpoint, it's required when you configure Sigma. 
Configure Databricks Connection
In the Databricks section of Azure, click on the warehouse instance > Databricks Workspace.
Click Launch Workspace.
In Databricks, select SQL in the Data Science & Engineering dropdown. 
Click Review SQL Warehouses.

For example, if the private endpoint name is databricks-endpoint, then you would enter the following in the Host field.
databrick-endpoint.pl-auth.azuredatabricks.net
ðŸ“˜
To locate the private endpoint's name, go to your Azure portal > click the Azure Databricks Workspace > click Networking on the left panel. The private endpoint name is displayed in the Private Endpoint column in Private endpoint connections.
Paste the HTTP path value from Azure into the HTTP path field in Sigma. 
Paste the token you created in Azure and enter into Access token field in Sigma.
