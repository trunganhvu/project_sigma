Suggest Edits
Convert a Unix timestamp to a Date data type.
ðŸ“˜
The UNIX timestamp is the number of seconds (or milliseconds) elapsed since an absolute point in time, midnight of Jan 1 1970 in UTC time. (UTC is Greenwich Mean Time without Daylight Savings time adjustments.) Regardless of your time zone, the UNIX timestamp represents a moment that is the same everywhere.
Usage
DateFromUnix(number)
number (required) A number or column of numbers, each of which represent a Unix-style timestamp.
ðŸ“˜
When you enter a number, the Date function behaves the same as DateFromUnix.
Examples

DateFromUnix(1503724894)
Returns 2017-08-26 05:21:34
