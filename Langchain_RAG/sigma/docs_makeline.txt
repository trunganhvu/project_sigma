MakeLine
Suggest Edits
The MakeLine function constructs a LineString from a series of Point or LineString data.
ðŸ“˜
This function isn't compatible with all data platform connections. To check if your connection supports it, see Supported data platforms and feature compatibility.
Syntax
MakeLine(geo1, geo2, ...)
The function has these arguments:
geo1
Required
A valid point or line value that can be located on the Earth's sphere; must comply with the Geographic Coordinate System
geo2
Required
A valid point or line value that can be located on the Earth's sphere; must comply with the Geographic Coordinate System
geo3 through geoN
Optional
A valid point or line value that can be located on the Earth's sphere; must comply with the Geographic Coordinate System
When using line segments in arguments, Sigma treats the terminal points of the line as separate points, in order. For example, the expression:
MakeLine(point1, MakeLine(point2, point3), Makeline(point4, point5, point6))
is the same as the expression:
MakeLine(point1, point2, point3, point4, point5, point6)
Examples
MakeLine([Point], MakePoint(-74.044502, 40.689247))
MakeLine(MakePoint(2.294481, 48.85837), [Point], MakePoint(-74.044502, 40.689247))
``
MakeLine(MakeLine(MakePoint(48.85837, 2.294481), MakePoint(-0.075278, 51.505554)), [Point], MakeLine(MakePoint(40.689247, -74.044502), MakePoint(-77.050636, 38.889248)))
These examples create lines between:

1. The points in the **Point** column, and the location of the Statue of Liberty at coordinates (-74.044502, 40.689247)
2. The location of the Eiffel Tower (2.294481, 48.85837), the **Point** column, and the location of the Statue of Liberty (-74.044502, 40.689247)
3. The line between the Eiffel Tower (2.294481, 48.85837) and the Tower Bridge ( -0.075278, 51.505554), the **Point** column, and the line between the Empire State building (-73.985428, 40.748817) and the Lincoln Memorial (-77.050636, 38.889248).
