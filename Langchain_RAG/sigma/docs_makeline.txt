Syntax
MakeLine(geo1, geo2, ...)
The function has these arguments:
geo1
Required
A valid point or line value that can be located on the Earth's sphere; must comply with the Geographic Coordinate System
geo2
Required
A valid point or line value that can be located on the Earth's sphere; must comply with the Geographic Coordinate System
geo3 through geoN
Optional
A valid point or line value that can be located on the Earth's sphere; must comply with the Geographic Coordinate System
When using line segments in arguments, Sigma treats the terminal points of the line as separate points, in order. For example, the expression:
MakeLine(point1, MakeLine(point2, point3), Makeline(point4, point5, point6))
is the same as the expression:
MakeLine(point1, point2, point3, point4, point5, point6)
Examples
MakeLine([Point], MakePoint(-74.044502, 40.689247))
MakeLine(MakePoint(2.294481, 48.85837), [Point], MakePoint(-74.044502, 40.689247))
``
MakeLine(MakeLine(MakePoint(48.85837, 2.294481), MakePoint(-0.075278, 51.505554)), [Point], MakeLine(MakePoint(40.689247, -74.044502), MakePoint(-77.050636, 38.889248)))
These examples create lines between:

1. The points in the **Point** column, and the location of the Statue of Liberty at coordinates (-74.044502, 40.689247)
2. The location of the Eiffel Tower (2.294481, 48.85837), the **Point** column, and the location of the Statue of Liberty (-74.044502, 40.689247)
3. The line between the Eiffel Tower (2.294481, 48.85837) and the Tower Bridge ( -0.075278, 51.505554), the **Point** column, and the line between the Empire State building (-73.985428, 40.748817) and the Lincoln Memorial (-77.050636, 38.889248).
