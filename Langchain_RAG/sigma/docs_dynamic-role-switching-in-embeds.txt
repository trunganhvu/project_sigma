Apply dynamic connection and role switching to embeds
Suggest Edits
You can use the embed API to dynamically assign a Snowflake warehouse and/or role at runtime for each user. This allows you to use different levels of security (as configured for a Snowflake role) as well as the compute tier used, based on the specified Snowflake warehouse.
This requires a moderate amount of configuration in Snowflake. See the QuickStart: Embedding 7: Dynamic Role Switching with Snowflake for detailed configuration guidance on the Snowflake configuration steps.
User attributes are created in Sigma to support passing the required values at runtime to Snowflake.
For example, if we want to restrict Snowflake data access based on the data in a column (like "Region"), that User Attribute configuration in Sigma might look like this:
User Attribute configuration example for "DRS_Warehouse"
After you create user attributes, you can apply them to the Snowflake connection in Sigma:
Warehouse and Role set to use User Attributes
Embed API Configuration
For example, these parameters would be added in "section 6" of the sample embed API code for ease of viewing
JavaScript
// NOTE: UA values are case sensitive. Multiple values can be separated by a comma. 
searchParams += '&:DRS_ROLE=DRS_WEST';
searchParams += '&:DRS_Warehouse=COMPUTE_WH';

User attributes are case sensitive.
