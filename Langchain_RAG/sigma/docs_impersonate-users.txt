Impersonate users is unavailable for organizations that use OAuth to authenticate.
To impersonate users, you must be assigned the Admin account type. This feature is not available to members who are only assigned as team admins.
Overview
The functionality to impersonate users provides admins with ability to assume a user and view, edit, access Sigma resources based on the user's account type.
When admins impersonate a user, they can identify and troubleshoot issues that a user experiences from their perspective. This lets admins resolve problems with greater efficiency so their users can resume work. Admins can also verify what documents the user can access and the corresponding permissions.
Some additional use cases include:
Validate row-level security (RLS)

When you impersonate a user, an event is created in audit logs that identifies the user and the impersonator.
