ArrayJoin
Suggest Edits
The ArrayJoin function joins elements of an array into a single text string.
üìò
This function isn't compatible with all data platform connections. To check if your connection supports it, see Supported data platforms and feature compatibility.
Syntax
ArrayJoin(array, [separator], [nullReplacement])
Function arguments:
array
An array containing elements to join into a single text string.
If you reference a column, it must be a variant column containing data structured as a JSON array (for example, [‚Äúred‚Äù, ‚Äúblue‚Äù, ‚Äúyellow‚Äù]). Other column types or data structured as JSON objects return null values.
separator
[optional] A character or string to return between joined elements.
If unspecified, Sigma applies a comma without spaces by default.
nullReplacement
[optional] A character or string to replace elements with null values.
If unspecified, Sigma omits null values by default
Notes
Nested JSON arrays or objects in the array arguments are converted into text strings using your data platform‚Äôs JSON-to-text method. This can impact the nested JSON structure, key-value pair order, and white space (like spaces, tabs, and line breaks).
If any argument is null, the function returns null.
Examples
Example 1
ArrayJoin([JSON array], ‚Äú, ‚Äù)
Returns a single text string containing each non-null element from the JSON array column separated by a comma and a space.
Example 2
ArrayJoin(Array(‚Äúred‚Äù, null, ‚Äúblue‚Äù, ‚Äúyellow‚Äù), ‚Äú or ‚Äù, ‚Äú*‚Äù)
Returns red or * or blue or yellow.
Example 3
ArrayJoin(Json('[[1,"a"], {"b":2}, "c", 3]'), ";")
Returns [1,"a"];{"b":2};c;3.
