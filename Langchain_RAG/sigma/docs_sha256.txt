SHA256(string)
Function arguments:
string The text value to be hashed.
Examples
In this example, you have a table with a User ID column. For privacy and confidentiality reasons, you might want to obfuscate the actual values in this column. You can use the SHA256 function to do so:
SHA256([User ID])
The function returns 256-bit hash values of each User ID.
