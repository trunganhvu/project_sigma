Configure a shareable link for an embed
Suggest Edits
You can enable your embed users to share workbooks, explorations, or bookmarks with other users using a link with your own domain name. Link sharing is not available for page or single element embeds.
These links can be copied and pasted, allowing recipients to access the content directly in your application. In addition, you can include the shareable link in the embed menu, embed footer, and scheduled export email notifications by configuring the workbook:sharinglink:update iframe event. See Implement inbound and outbound events in embeds for details.
For a full example implementation, see Embedding 17: Link Sharing QuickStart and the accompanying sample code in the GitHub repo.
Set up a shareable URL for your embed
To enable your embed users to share links, update your application code as follows:
Extract the exploreKey using the workbook:exploreKey:onchange iframe event. See Implement inbound and outbound events in embeds.
Append a parameter that contains the exploreKey to your host application URL whenever an embed user makes or updates an exploration in your application.
For example:
JavaScript
window.addEventListener('message', function (event) {
   if (event.source === document.getElementById('sigma-iframe').contentWindow &&
      event.origin === "https://app.sigmacomputing.com") {
      // Handle exploreKey changes
      if (event.data.type === 'workbook:exploreKey:onchange') {
         // Append exploreKey to your URL
         params.append(":exploreKey", event.data.exploreKey);
      }
   }
});
Configure your application to parse the exploreKey from the URL when an embed user follows a link. This step allows your app to generate a secure embed URL for the embed user with the exploreKey so that Sigma can render the corresponding embed view. See Example embed API and URL for a detailed example of how to generate a secure embed URL in your application.
For example:
JavaScript
// Handle exploreKey if present
const exploreKey = req.query.exploreKey;
// Append exploreKey, if present, to the secure embed URL that will be passed to the iframe 
if (exploreKey) {
    searchParams += `&:explore=${exploreKey}`;
}
searchParams += `&:bookmark=&{bookmarkId}`;
[optional] If you want your embed users to be able to share bookmarks, repeat steps 1 through 3 to extract the bookmarkId using the workbook:bookmark:onchange iframe event, append it to your host application URL, and include it as a parameter when generating your secure embed URL.
For example:
JavaScript
window.addEventListener('message', function (event) {
 if (event.source === document.getElementById('sigma-iframe').contentWindow &&
     event.origin === "https://app.sigmacomputing.com") {
     // Handle bookmarkId changes
     if (event.data.type === 'workbook:bookmark:onchange') {
         // Append bookmarkId to your URL
         params.append(":bookmarkId", event.data.exploreKey); 
     }
 }
});
Example appending the bookmarkId to the embed URL:
JavaScript
// Handle bookmark if present
const bookmarkId = req.query.bookmarkId;
// Append bookmarkId, if present, to the secure embed URL that will be passed to the iframe
if (bookmarkId) {
 searchParams += `&:bookmark=${bookmarkId}`;
}
After you complete the above steps, users can share embeds with each other by copying and pasting the application URL from the browser address bar.
Add sharing functionality to your application
Using workbook:sharinglink:update, provide the URL in the sharingLink property that will appear in the embed menu, embed footer, and scheduled exports. Include the exploreKey parameter in this link if you want the embed users to share explorations by default.
[optional] If you want to give the embed user the option to send a link to the current exploration or a link to the original workbook, supply a second URL that includes the value from the exploreKey parameter in the sharingExplorationLink property. If you want your users to always share their current exploration, you can choose to include the exploreKey in the value for sharingLink and omit the sharingExplorationLink. See Implement inbound and outbound events in embeds for details.
For example:
JavaScript
// Function to send sharing links back to Sigma
function sendSharingLinks() {
 const baseUrl = window.location.origin + window.location.pathname;
 const sharingLink = currentBookmarkId
     ? `${baseUrl}?&bookmarkId=${currentBookmarkId}`
     : baseUrl;
 const sharingExplorationLink = currentExploreKey
     ? currentBookmarkId
         ? `${baseUrl}?exploreKey=${currentExploreKey}&bookmarkId=${currentBookmarkId}`
         : `${baseUrl}?exploreKey=${currentExploreKey}`
     : null;
 iframe.contentWindow.postMessage(
     {
         type: "workbook:sharinglink:update",
         sharingLink: sharingLink,
         sharingExplorationLink: sharingExplorationLink,
     },
     "https://app.sigmacomputing.com"
 );
}
ðŸ“˜
Sigma loads the URL you supply using this event to anyone given this sharing link. Ensure that your application authenticates users before displaying the content.
Test the sharing links in your embed
After you complete the steps to set up sharable URLs and add them to your application, test the results in your application.
Confirm that a share icon appears in the footer of your embedded content and that the Share... option appears in the embed menu.
ðŸ“˜
If you configured your embed to exclude a footer, you can construct your own share modal or button in your application and supply the sharing link to your users that way.
Start an exploration on your embedded content, then click Share.
In the Share this content modal, confirm that the Link to current exploration checkbox appears.
ðŸ“˜
The Link to current exploration checkbox appears only if the user has an active exploration on the embed and the embed application developer supplied a sharingExplorationLink.
Click Copy Link to test the link with the checkbox unchecked. In a new private browser window, test the link to confirm that your user authentication works as you have configured it for your embed and that the page resolves to the URL configured in the sharingLink property.
If you have a Link to exploration checkbox, check that box, then click Copy Link again. In a new private browser window, test the link to confirm that your user authentication works as you have configured it for your embed and that the page resolves to the URL configured in the sharingExplorationLink property.
In the embed menu, click Schedule exports....
Create a new export schedule to send to your own email address, then click More > Send now.
Confirm that the email you receive contains an Open button. Click the Open button to confirm that your user authentication works as you have configured it for your embed and that page resolves to the URL configured in the sharingLink property.
