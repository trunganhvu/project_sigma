The CurrentUserEmail function returns the email address associated with the current (signed-in) user's account.
To return the user's first or full name, use the CurrentUserFirstName or CurrentUserFullName function.
Usage
CurrentUserEmail()
ðŸ“˜
CurrentUserEmail has no function arguments because itâ€™s context-sensitive and doesnâ€™t depend on any explicitly provided values.
Example
A dataset contains information about sales opportunities, including a Rep Email column that identifies the email address of the corresponding Sales representative. To implement email-based row-level security (RLS), an admin adds a new RLS column populated by the following formula:
CurrentUserEmail() = [Rep Email]
The RLS column returns True when the current user's email address matches the value in the Rep Email column.
To ensure each Sales representative can only view their own opportunities, the admin hides the RLS column and filters the dataset to only include rows in which the RLS value is True.
