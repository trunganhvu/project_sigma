This documentation should not be considered part of our published documentation until this notice, and the corresponding Beta flag on the feature in the Sigma service, are removed.

Beta features are subject to the Beta features disclaimer.
Sigma provides several methods to allow users and developers to interact with its systems, including a web user interface, a public REST API, a JavaScript Embed API, and an SDK for the React framework.
The Embed SDK for React offers a higher-level, developer-friendly interface that simplifies integration into applications, in contrast to Sigmaâ€™s lower-level JavaScript Embed API, which provides more granular control but may require additional coding.
The source code is freely available on Github. Developers can clone the repository and refer to the comments in the code for each file.
Additionally, there is a QuickStart for a more in-depth guide to using the SDK.
The source contains a working application with a sample embed based on Sigma provided content.
