Product Leaders strive to build applications that solve business problems, drive engagement, and boost user adoption. This often requires multiple tools, highly paid developers coding in multiple languages, and complicated processes to orchestrate.

Most embedded analytics are limited to a few static charts. Not with Sigma. You can now provide the same powerful Sigma experience to your customers, vendors, or other external users. Your external users get the same capabilities you give your employees—secure, real-time insights, and no boundaries to exploration in a true self-service analytics environment. The results are faster time-to-market, no code workbook development, and the best-in-class SDLC process. 
Boost developer productivity and solve the build-vs-buy dilemma
Thinking about building vs buying? You could hire a small army of developers to build and maintain internal software (and take on the risk of losing that critical IP if they decide to leave) or you can embed Sigma and get a world-class analytics experience with proven functionality and dedicated support on Day 1.

With Sigma doing all the heavy lifting, you’ll have more time to focus on higher value initiatives, like offering a premium analytics solution or monetizing your data. With a faster time-to-market, you can iterate and experiment without spending development resources. 

[You can even leverage Sigma’s themes to customize the look and feel, consistent with your application’s brand.]
Realize true self-service in a secure environment
When you embed Sigma, you embed options. Give your users read-only analytics… or give them the ability to build, change, share, and save insights on their data. All with the security and controls you need to safely manage embedded analytics.

You can continue to authenticate your customers using your application’s existing sign-on framework, without needing to worry about provisioning or authenticating users in Sigma. Sigma leverages one-time use, unmodifiable URLs to secure each user’s session. Sigma provides a variety of row-level security mechanisms to ensure each user has access to allowed data.

No need for training
With Sigma embedded analytics, your customers get the same spreadsheet-like interface that your employees have. That means you don’t get those “how does this work” questions and even better, you don’t get frustrated customers. Boost adoption with a familiar, enterprise-grade user experience with real-time insights on billions of rows of data with lightning-fast performance.

Prefer beautiful data visualizations instead? No problem, we do both!
“We are 2.5X more efficient; Sigma delivers a powerful solution that has democratized data access, enabling rapid prototyping, and innovation.”
Evan Hou, Head of Analytics, Whatnot
