Improving patient outcomes in underserved communities: Why Leap Metrics calls Sigma “life saving.”
By Srini Gorty
CEO AND FOUNDER, LEAP METRICS
Srini Gorty is CEO and Founder of Leap Metrics, an analytics-first health care platform. The company’s mission is to empower the healthcare industry to have the right information to care for every life. Leap is one of the first products of its kind helping Native American tribes better manage health outcomes. 
Leap’s Social Mission 
Our platform empowers one of the largest federally-recognized tribes by assisting with the data management and analytics needs that power their managed-care efforts. We are one of the first platforms to leverage AI, in an analytics-first approach to care management. Tribes have unique health care needs, so being able to use AI-powered analytics to proactively identify and highlight care gaps, prioritize key health care challenges, impact outcomes, and report to conform to State and Federal contracts is paramount. Additionally, most tribes are located in remote, rural areas with limited access to health care which makes care coordination challenging. Our platform gives clients anywhere the ability to analyze their population health with a tool that pulls together data from any source, in any format, allowing them to make informed decisions and develop proactive care plans. 
Tribes have unique health care needs, so being able to use AI-powered analytics to proactively identify and highlight care gaps, impact outcomes, and conform to State and Federal contracts is paramount.
Our dashboards that share member health alerts can expedite care in emergent situations, and longitudinal patient records power proactive care that can prevent some of these emergencies from occuring in the first place. This helps tribes, and other populations, drive better outcomes and care experiences for the communities they serve.
Life before Sigma 
Leap aggregates data and makes insights derived from the data available for workflows in real time. Our team also analyzes data from various sources to identify trends and anomalies. An adaptable and scalable business intelligence solution that works well with our data platform was essential to our success.

Before using Sigma, it was cumbersome to use some BI tools to analyze data and the insights generated by our platform rapidly. Sigma made our team much more productive and efficient in understanding the data, modeling algorithms, and presenting solutions to customers to ideate and enable them with dashboards that they can effectively use for data exploration.
BI tool evaluation 
Many solutions in the marketplace are too complex for embedded use cases and are not easy to host and use on any platform. Couple that with the compliance needs of health care, and your choices are limited. Sigma has many benefits, including:
Natively built for the cloud and web
Secure and compliant
Embeddable in a multi-tenant environment
Shareable data models
Strong data exploration capabilities
Self-serve capabilities
Ease of use for our engineers and customers
Strong integration with popular data platforms
Highly performant platform
Ongoing innovation
Exceptional customer service
Many solutions in the marketplace are too complex for embedded use cases.
We needed a solution that our data engineers and data scientists would love, and that our customers would embrace. Sigma was a perfect match for us.
Life with Sigma 
Sigma is our data whiteboard. Having a quick and performant view of the data has helped our organization analyze datasets rapidly. Sigma also facilitates conversations amongst our engineers and shortens the decision-making process. We can put a face on the data for our customers when they review new datasets, which was cumbersome before we switched to Sigma. 
Having strong data and near real-time analytics gives the full picture of patient health.
One of our customers receives provider data with hundreds of columns and millions of rows. The customer never had meaningful visibility into the dataset prefore.  Our team was able to distill the essential parts of the data and send it to the customer. Our customers now converse with their data partners armed with a Sigma dashboard, cutting down time-to-issue resolution by weeks.
Our data team constantly analyzes data of many dimensions to measure health care outcomes, and Sigma allows them to stage the data and analyze it to understand patterns. The ability to explore and communicate visually with each other through Sigma – as opposed to using SQL – has significantly enriched the team’s engineering experience.
There’s an abundance of health care data available, but it’s only useful if care teams are able to access it and action on it. We believe that having strong data and near real-time analytics gives health care the full picture of patient health, driving informed clinical and operational decisions. This results in better outcomes, improved experiences, and reduces the cost of care.
Sigma Impact 
Our mission is built on the ability to serve lives through harnessing data and delivering actionable analytics to payers and providers of all sizes. We’re equipped to serve every organization with whole-person care needs, and the more lives we can touch the further we’ve driven our mission. Collecting and analyzing social determinants of health data, as well as clinical health data, empowers those caring for chronic and polychronic conditions. These populations include mental and behavioral health, aging populations, and IDD (intellectual and developmental disabilities).
The impact of the analytics we expose through Sigma is life-saving.
Our customers help patients with chronic conditions. They prioritize stratifying member risk and staying on top of care gaps. Sigma enables easy and effective access to members who require immediate attention. The quality dashboards identify members who require proactive care, reducing the likelihood of utilization of high-cost health care services. The impact of the analytics we expose through Sigma is life-saving.
