About sharing with users, teams, and all organization members
When you share a workbook with an individual user, the availability of workbook permissions depends on the user's account type.
Workbook permission Minimum required account type permission Description
Can view View workbooks The user can view and interact with workbook elements in View mode.
Can explore Full explore In addition to Can view capabilities, the user can modify workbook elements to create custom views of the workbook in Explore mode.
Can edit Create, edit, and publish workbooks
In addition to Can view and Can explore capabilities, the user can manage the workbook (rename, move, or delete), view hidden pages, and save changes to the published version.
If the Share documents account type permission is enabled, the user can also share the workbook with other organization members.
When you share a workbook with all members of your organization or a specific team, individual user access is based on the most restrictive grant (the one with the least privileges) between the workbook permission and account type permission. For example, if you grant Can edit permission to all members of your organization, but a user is assigned an account type with only View workbooks permissions enabled, that specific user is limited to Can view workbook privileges.
For more information about workbook permissions and modes, see Folder and document permissions and Workbook modes overview.

If you have not yet saved your workbook, you can still share the exploration. In the header, click Share (), then turn on Allow access by link.
Limit access to workbook contents by hiding pages
You can hide pages in a workbook from users with only Can Explore and Can View permissions on a workbook. To hide a page, see Manage workbook page visibility.
Respond to requests for access to content
As a workbook owner, if a user attempts to access your content and doesn't have permission to do so, they can request access through the error page blocking their immediate access. Access requests are emailed to the document owner.
To respond to a request to access the document, do the following:
Open the email notification, then click Respond to the Request.
A web browser window opens to the Sigma service. After logging in, the Share Workbook modal opens. You can see and respond to the access request.
(Optional) For the requesting user, click the permission dropdown menu to select the appropriate level of access. For a version tagged workbook, you can choose a specific permission and version tag combination to grant the user access to view or explore a specific tagged version of the workbook.

The user can't be granted access higher than what their account type allows.
To approve the request, click Approve.
The user is granted access to view the workbook and immediately shows up in the list of people and teams with access.
To deny the request, click Deny.
Access to the workbook remains unchanged and the request is removed from the Share Workbook modal.
Click Save.
