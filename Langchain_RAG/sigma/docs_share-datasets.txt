Respond to a request for access to content
If a user attempts to access your content and doesn't have permissions to do so, they can request access through the error page blocking their immediate access. This triggers a Request to Access email notification. 
To respond to the Request for Access, do the following:
In the email notification, click the Respond to the Request button.
Sigma opens with the Share Dataset modal, allowing you to view the current access requests. Optionally, click the permission drop-down menu to select the level of access the user should have.
Note: The user cannot be granted access higher than what their account type allows.
If desired, click Approve. If Approve is selected, the request is removed from the Share Dataset modal, and the user is listed in the Who Has Access tab.

Or, click Deny. If Deny is selected, the request is removed from the Share dataset modal. 
Click Save or close the Share Dataset modal. Your decision on the Request for Access to Content will save either way.
