Suggest Edits
The Max function finds the maximum value for a column or group.
Syntax
Max(field)
Function arguments:
field (required) - The column to be searched. Can be of type Number, Date, and String.
The maximum for strings is determined by sort order, which is affected by your database settings. Sort order is most often blank spaces > special characters > numbers > uppercase letters > lowercase letters.
For numbers, preceding and trailing zeroes often have no affect on sort order.
Example
Max([Invoice Date])
Finds the greatest Invoice Date, which is the most recent invoice date.
Max([Name])
Finds the name that is alphabetically last.
