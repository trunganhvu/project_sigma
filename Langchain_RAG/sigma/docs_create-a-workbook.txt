Suggest Edits
Workbooks are a Sigma document type designed to support both ad hoc data exploration and complex long-term reporting. The collaborative interface and visual approach to data interaction make live data accessible to everyone in your organization.
Unsaved workbooks are referred to as explorations and are available in the Recents page for 30 days.
This document shows how to create a new workbook. For more information see Workbooks overview.
Requirement
To create new workbooks and explorations, you must be assigned the Creator, Admin, or custom account type with the appropriate permissions.
