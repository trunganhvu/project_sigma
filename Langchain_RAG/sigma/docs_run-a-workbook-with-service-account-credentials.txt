Run a workbook with service account credentials
Suggest Edits
On workbooks created with data from an OAuth connection with a service account, an admin can configure the workbook to run queries using the service account instead of each user’s OAuth credentials.
OAuth tokens can expire if the owner goes a significant amount of time without logging in to Sigma. If this happens, scheduled exports and materialization schedules configured by that user fail. This limitation can be avoided by running the workbook with service account credentials.
This setting changes how Sigma queries data and evaluates permissions for the workbook. Refer to the following table to compare the behavior:
Workbook using an OAuth connection, with Run as service account configured. Sigma queries the published version of the workbook using the data connection’s service account credentials whenever it is viewed from within Sigma or run as part of a scheduled report. This ensures that any user with permissions on a workbook can view it, regardless of their permissions in the cloud data warehouse.
Workbook using an OAuth connection, without Run as service account configured. Sigma always runs queries with the organization member's OAuth credentials. This includes when users are viewing workbooks owned by others.
Workbook using a non-OAuth connection. Sigma evaluates the workbook owner's permission to the source data and then runs queries using the user account credentials set in the connection settings.
Requirements
To configure this setting on a workbook, you must be assigned the Admin account type.
The Run as service account option is only available on workbooks using an OAuth connection for which a service account has been configured. For information on how to configure a connection with a service account, see the documentation for your connection type:
Connect to Snowflake
Connect to Databricks
Run an individual workbook as a service account
Open the workbook in Published mode.
Click the caret () to open the workbook menu.
Select Share….
