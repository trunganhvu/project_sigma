Datasets

Model your data in Sigma using datasets, or collections of data based on tables in your CDW or DBMS.
Datasets function as centralized, shareable data definitions and can include aggregations and other data manipulations. Admins define datasets that are used in workbook analyses as sources for visualizations, tables, and pivot tables.
Workbooks inherit all changes applied to underlying datasets, ensuring consistent, reliable metric calculations. When metric logic requires an update, you can apply the change in one location (the dataset), and all applicable workbooks automatically inherit and reflect the updated calculations.
