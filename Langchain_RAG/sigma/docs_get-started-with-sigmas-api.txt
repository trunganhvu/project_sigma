About the Sigma REST API
Suggest Edits
Sigmaâ€™s REST API provides developer access to resources programmatically, using HTTP. The API allows secure access to all the commonly used resources like connections, datasets, teams, workbooks and more. The API can be used to create custom applications or integrations with Sigma. JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors.
See Get started with the Sigma REST API for more details.
You can use the Sigma API to automate operations in support of native and embed workflows.
