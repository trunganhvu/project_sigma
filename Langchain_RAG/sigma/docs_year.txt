Syntax
Year(date, [timezone])
Function arguments:
date (required) - the date or column containing date values from which the year component is extracted
timezone (optional) - the IANA time zone (e.g., ‚ÄúAmerica/Los_Angeles‚Äù) to convert the date value to before extracting the year component
üìò
When the timezone argument is omitted, the input date is evaluated in UTC time.
Example
Year(Date("2007-08-14"))
Extracts the year component from the specified date (August 14, 2007) and returns 2007 to represent the year.
