Requirements
To add and edit text elements, you must have Can Edit access to the individual workbook.
Create a Text Element
Before you start: This action is only available in Edit mode. To begin editing, click Edit in the top right corner of the page; see Workbook lifecycle.
Open the workbook's ADD NEW panel, accessible from the + button located in the sidebar on the left side of the page.
On the ELEMENTS tab, under UI ELEMENTS, click TEXT. 
Your new text element will appear selected on the page.
Begin typing to enter text.
Use the toolbar at the top of the page to add custom formatting or hyperlinks.
Use your cursor to drag and drop the element anywhere on the page canvas.
Apply Formatting to a Text Element
Before you start: This action is only available in Edit mode. To begin editing, click Edit in the top right corner of the page; see Workbook lifecycle.
Click the element to select it.
Select the text you want to format.
Use the toolbar at the top of the page to select your format option(s).
Add Dynamic Text Based on Your Data
When editing a workbook, you can inject dynamic text into text elements. Dynamic text is text generated based on a formula. This is helpful if you want to display element headers or inline text that automatically updates based on your data.
Open a workbook in Edit mode.
Select the text element to which you want to add dynamic text.
Place your cursor where you want to insert the dynamic text, then enter = or select Formula in the workbook toolbar.
A formula bar displays over the text element.
In the formula bar, enter a formula that generates the dynamic value you want to include in the text. As you begin typing a function or the name of an existing element, you can choose from the autofill suggestions.
ðŸ’¡
To include metric output in dynamic text, create a calculation column that references the metric, then reference that table and column in the dynamic text formula.
Hit Enter on your keyboard.
[optional] To apply formatting:
Select your new dynamic text.
Choose a format option from the toolbar.
