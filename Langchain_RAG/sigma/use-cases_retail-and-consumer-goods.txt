VIEW STORY
“We have our customer table and transaction-level data from our e-commerce store as well as our brick-and-mortar retail stores. Sigma has been really helpful in collating all of our data together so we can create rich customer 360s. We're no longer isolated in our view of the customer from just the online shopper but have been able to add color from the brick-and-mortar shopper as well.”
Raashi Hasija, Head of CRM, Veronica Beard

"Since implementing Sigma, we have been able to quickly get insights into how a delivery day went and tweak our labor planning, increase capacity in different areas, identify optimal delivery windows, and better allocate resources."
