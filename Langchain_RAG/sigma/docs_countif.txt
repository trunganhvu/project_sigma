CountIf
Suggest Edits
The Count function returns the number of rows in a table or group for which all given conditions are true.
Syntax
CountIf(condition 1, condition 2+...)
Function arguments:
condition 1 (required) The condition to test. If the condition is True, then the row will be counted.
You can use operators in conditions.
condition 2+ (optional) Additional conditions to test. If multiple conditions are given, they must all be True in order to be counted.
Example
For example, to count rows where the value in the Age column is greater than 65:
CountIf([Age] > 65)
To count rows where the value in the Age column is greater than 65 and the State column has a value of Ohio:
CountIf([Age] > 65, [State] = ”Ohio”)
To count rows where the value for the Submitted column is a Boolean True, you can use either of the following syntax:
CountIf([Submitted] = True)
CountIf([Submitted])
You can also combine this function with functions that return Boolean output, such as IsNotNull:
CountIf(IsNotNull([Order Number]))
