Proper
Suggest Edits
The Proper function converts text to proper case, which capitalizes the first letter of each word and renders all remaining letters in lowercase.
Syntax
Proper(string)
Function arguments:
string (required) - a text string or column to reference when converting text to proper case
ðŸš§
If the string argument references a column, the column must contain text values. Other data value types result in an invalid formula.
Examples
Proper("aPPles AnD oranGEs")
Returns Apples And Oranges.
Proper([Product Family])
Returns the proper form of the text value in the Product Family column.
