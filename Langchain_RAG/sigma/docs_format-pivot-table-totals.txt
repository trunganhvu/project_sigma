Format pivot table totals
Suggest Edits
By default, Sigma applies the same format to pivot table values and totals. While you can use table styles to customize the general cell format, you can also apply unique formats to subtotals and grand totals.
This document describes the format options for pivot table totals and explains how to customize the display of rows and columns containing subtotals and grant totals. To show or hide subtotals and grand totals, see Pivot table totals and subtotals.
User requirements
The ability to format pivot table totals requires the following:
You must be assigned an account type with the Explore workbooks or Create, edit, and publish workbooks permission enabled.
You must be the workbook owner or be granted Can explore or Can edit workbook permission.
