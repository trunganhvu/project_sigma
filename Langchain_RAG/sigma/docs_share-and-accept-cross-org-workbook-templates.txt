Share and accept cross-org workbook templates
Suggest Edits
Cross-org sharing allows you to share and accept workbook templates across different Sigma organizations. When the receiving organization accepts a shared template, they must choose their own data source to populate the template, ensuring no data from the sharing organization is disclosed.
This document explains how to share and accept a workbook template across organizations.
User requirements
To share or accept a workbook template through cross-org sharing, you must be assigned the Admin account type.
Share a template with another organization
Go to your Home page.
In the navigation menu, select Templates.
In the Templates page, locate the template you want to share, then click More and select Share from the menu.
ðŸ“˜
To add new template, first click Create Template, then create a template from a saved workbook.
In the Share Template modal, click Share across Sigma Orgs.
In the Cross Org Share Template modal, provide the required information:
In the Company Login URL Slug field, enter the slug associated with the receiving organization. This is a unique identifier that typically follows app.sigmacomputing.com/ in the Sigma URL.
[optional] In the Add a message field, enter a message to include in the invitation email Sigma sends to the receiving organization's admins.
Click Share Template.
Accept a template shared with your organization
When your organization receives an invitation to use a shared template, you or another admin must swap the data source (to populate the template with your organization's data) before accepting it. The template will not be available to your organization members until this is completed.
In the invitation email, click Open in Sigma.
In the Swap Data Sources Overview modal, Sigma identifies connections and data sources that closely match the data used in the original template. Choose from these matches to automatically swap the data, or manually select and match individual data source columns.
Use a matching connection and data source:
In the Matching Connection and Matching Data Sources fields, select the relevant options.
Click Choose to preview the template with the swapped data.
Manually select and map the data:
Click Match Manually.
In the Swap Data Sources screen, preview the column names from the template's original data source, then click Select Source.
In the Select source to replace modal, select the preferred data source to populate the template. To view and select a data source from a different connection, click Back in the source selector.
Review the selected data, then click Select to proceed.
In the Swap Data Sources screen, map the template's original data source columns to the swapped data source columns.
Click Choose to preview the template with the swapped data.
To save the template with the swapped data, click Accept in the workbook header. Otherwise, click Swap sources and repeat step 2 to select different data.
