Lag
Suggest Edits
The Lag function accesses data in preceding rows in the same result set, without having to join the table to itself. It references a column and returns its values in the offset position, shifting the output down by a fixed number of rows.
The Lag function typically shifts values down, while the Lead function shifts values up.

These are the function arguments:

Lag([Attendance], 1)
A table lists the total attendance for each game of an MLB team's 2021 season. You can use the Lag function to compare this value with the number of attendees recorded for the previous game.
The formula references the Attendance column and shifts its values down one row. The resulting output in each row of the Previous Game column indicates the number of people who attended the game that occurred immediately before the one referenced in the Game Key column.
