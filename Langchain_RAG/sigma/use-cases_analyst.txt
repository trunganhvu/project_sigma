Analysts are closer to the business than anyone, but are often too buried in the reporting backlog to focus on higher-value initiatives. Legacy BI tools only make the problem worse because they are slow, restrictive, and require constant end-user training to achieve self-service. 

Sigma is fast and familiar. Live query = no data movement, no pre-defined drill paths, and no scale limitations. Sigma‚Äôs spreadsheet-like interface enables users to freely explore ALL their data, drilling into the smallest detail. For analysts, that means less time writing reports and more time solving complex business problems.
Build better content, faster
Connect, visualize, and publish content in minutes. Build pivots, answers, and advanced analysis with ease. Share those insights with others and let them continue to explore in a secure, governed environment.
Collaborate with your stakeholders in real time
Reduce reporting back-and-forth and improve self-service by collaborating with your users in real time. Annotate data to improve data literacy and boost data fluency. Sigma will help your users understand and speak the language of data like never before.
Work with all of your data
Speed ‚úîÔ∏è Scale ‚úîÔ∏è Complex data models ‚úîÔ∏è

Whether it's a simple csv upload, an existing dataset from your warehouse, or anything in between, use Sigma to create a model or start exploring model-free. It‚Äôs your choice. 

Business logic, reusable metrics, data lineage, and more. Datasets in Sigma allow ultimate flexibility to work with your data however you want.
‚ÄúWe are 2.5X more efficient; Sigma delivers a powerful solution that has democratized data access, enabling rapid prototyping, and innovation.‚Äù
