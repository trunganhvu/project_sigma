Accelerating data analysis with the power of AI
Ask Sigma
Ask Sigma is a natural language query interface that responds to your question while also guiding you through every step of the analytical process and giving you new ways to interact with the data.
What sets Ask Sigma apart is its commitment to discovery, transparency, control, and a path forward for the user.  Unlike black-box AI solutions, Ask Sigma shows you exactly how it arrives at each answer—and gives you the option to edit any step of the analysis or even choose a different data source to start with. Ask Sigma highlights popular workbooks, relevant datasets, and even provides additional analysis related to your question. You can open any parts of the analysis into a Sigma workbook to dive deeper into your query.
Ask Sigma:
Enables self-service analytics
Reduces interruptions to the data team
Upskills less technical users
Makes it easier to locate the right data and metrics
Maintains organizational governance and security around how users interact with AI

AI Query
Take full advantage of your cloud data warehouse's AI capabilities and unlock deeper insights directly within Sigma. AI Query lets you apply popular LLMs to you data through simple SQL functions, making advanced AI capabilities accessible while keeping your data secure and governed within your existing infrastructure.
‍
Ask Sigma and AI Query make AI convenient, flexible, and transparent, helping everyone on your team—from data analysts to decision-makers—tap into the power of AI.
Operational Reporting That Scales
Building sophisticated, flexible reports with pivot tables that scale with your business has never been more manageable.
Custom Subtotals
With Custom Subtotals, you can define subtotals at any level of a pivot table and gain more control over how data is aggregated and visualized. This feature provides the flexibility you need to create insightful financial reports and operational analyses.
‍
Hierarchies and Ragged Hierarchies
Our enhancements to hierarchies make it easier for you to model complex organizational structures, including parent-child relationships. With these updates, you can create more detailed reports and perform ad hoc analysis leveraging your data's inherent structure. Hierarchies unlock a new dimension to Sigma’s powerful analytical capabilities, empowering you to dive deeper into your data.

‍
Whether you're analyzing regional sales performance or drilling into departmental budgets, you can now easily navigate multiple levels of data relationships.
Export Bursting
Automate the generation and distribution of customized reports at scale. Export Bursting ensures access to consistent data across your organization while saving time and driving efficiency.

These reporting enhancements help teams create reliable, in-depth reports that support better decision-making without the complexity of legacy BI tools.
Infrastructure That Adapts to Your Enterprise
Our latest enterprise-grade infrastructure improvements ensure your data is always secure and accessible to those with the appropriate permissions.
Multiple Identity Providers (IdPs)
Seamlessly manage multiple data warehouses for different user groups via different OAuth providers. This feature makes handling complex organizational structures and external collaborators easier while maintaining strict security standards.
Enhanced Security
New support for JWT (JSON Web Token) and PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) for OAuth authorization ensures your data is always protected by the latest security standards while simplifying integration with existing systems.

Database/Catalog Parameterization
Control data access with fine-grained isolation at the database or catalog level. This feature enables embedded analytics customers to have more precise governance, simplifying the management of complex data environments at scale.
This collection of features gives you the tools to manage data access securely and at scale, offering peace of mind for enterprise teams.
Tools for Data Teams
We’re simplifying life for data teams with enhanced capabilities designed to boost efficiency, accelerate performance, and drive faster results. 
Write-back for Amazon Redshift
We’re bringing our write-back feature—Input Tables—to Redshift. Now, you can build scenarios, augment existing models, and comment and collaborate on your Redshift data directly within Sigma. This feature streamlines workflows by enabling users to take action on their data without leaving the Sigma environment, making the analytics process more efficient and reducing the need for additional tools.
Materialization Improvements
We’re introducing an integration with Snowflake Dynamic Tables and new Dependent Materialization schedules—built to scale with organizations with many creators. These updates optimize computational resources and streamline workflows, especially when managing complex dependencies.
Regional Expansion
Sigma will be available in more regions, including Azure West Europe and AWS US East, ensuring you can use Sigma wherever your data resides. Harness the full potential of your data in real-time, experience reduced latency, improved performance, and meet regional compliance requirements.
These updates make it easier for data teams to build, manage, and scale their analytics, regardless of the complexity of their data environments.
Sneak Peek: Data Apps
Sigma’s latest innovation, Data Apps, transforms analytics into action. Built on your cloud data warehouse, these low-code applications bring workflows, decisions, and collaboration into one unified experience—without compromising on security or governance.
Picture this: Sales reps input forecasts directly in Sigma. Managers approve them with automated notifications. Real-time, AI-powered insights enrich the data—all in one platform. Personalized views ensure every user gets exactly what they need, eliminating the need to jump between tools.
With Data Apps, teams can simplify processes, collaborate seamlessly, and move from insights to outcomes faster. Stay tuned for the full launch in March 2025.
