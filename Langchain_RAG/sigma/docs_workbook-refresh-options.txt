Suggest Edits
Sigma refreshes workbook data every time an individual opens or refreshes the workbook. If you want to refresh workbook data on a set schedule, such as for a workbook displayed on a screen without user interaction, you can set a custom refresh schedule.
Data elements can also be refreshed individually, but not on an automated schedule.
ðŸš©
Sigma does not store data. Every refresh re-queries the data in the warehouse. Setting an auto-refresh can burden the connection and result in significant warehouse costs.
Requirements
To set up a refresh schedule, you must have Can Edit access to the individual workbook and you must be assigned an account type with the Set workbook data refresh permission enabled.
If your workbook is embedded in a host application, the secure embed must be authenticated with JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for a custom refresh schedule to apply to the embedded content. See Create an embed API with JSON Web Tokens (Beta).
Set up a refresh schedule
To set up a refresh schedule for a workbook, do the following:
Click the caret () More options to the right of the refresh button in the workbook header.
Select Data refresh.
The Data refresh settings modal opens.
For Refresh schedule, turn on the Enable toggle.
Adjust the Query data every field to specify how often to refresh the workbook. For example, every 10 minutes.
[optional] To limit the refresh schedule to a specific time window, enter times in the Between fields. Sigma uses the browser timezone to evaluate whether the refresh schedule should be in effect.
Click Save.
Refresh individual data elements
You can manually refresh the data in an individual data element.
Select the data element.
In the element toolbar, click More.
Click Refresh data.
The data in the element refreshes.
