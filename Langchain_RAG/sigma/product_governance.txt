Built-in governance for collaborative teams
SIGMA BRINGS TRUST & FLEXIBILITY TO DATA EXPLORATION.
HAVE PEACE OF MIND WITH SIGMA, LIKE THESE COMPANIES
Worry-free self-service
Get the best of both worlds: ad hoc analysis for business teams, but within a set of guardrails controlled by the data and IT teams.
REDUCE RISK
End the extract
Legacy BI tools rely heavily on data extracts, creating risk for data leaks and leading to inaccurate data. Sigma ends the extract by keeping the spreadsheets where they belong, in your cloud data platform.
FAST
Seamless provisioning
Simple and flexible permission management makes it easy to onboard new users and change permissions in bulk, all with 100% auditability and security.
MANAGE SPEND
Optimize cloud investment
You control your cloud data platform spend. Easily track every query and optimize compute with out-of-the-box Sigma usage and cloud performance dashboards.
SEMANTIC MODELING
Ensure consistency in metrics
Data models in Sigma contain all the primitives you need to build a robust, fully governed semantic model: reusable tables, relationships, metrics, role-based permissions, version tagging on data models, and more.
