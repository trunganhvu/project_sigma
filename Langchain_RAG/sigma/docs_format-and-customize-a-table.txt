Format and customize a table
Suggest Edits
You can efficiently and effectively design and format the display of your tabular data in Sigma. Sigma provides preset display styles for out-of-the-box aesthetics and readability, or you can customize style components independently for more personalized table designs.
You can format and customize tables, pivot tables, and input tables, and apply the formatting at different levels of workbook development:
Admins can define a default table style in an organization-wide workbook theme. See Create and manage workbook themes.
Specify table styles for all tables, including pivot tables and input tables, in a workbook. See Table style settings in Workbook settings overview.
Apply table styles to one table element. See Customize the table style for an individual element on this page.
Format data in a given column. See Format column data on this page.
Format data in columns based on a condition. See Apply conditional formatting on this page.
