CurrentUserFullName
Suggest Edits
The CurrentUserFullName function returns the current (signed-in) user’s first and last name as configured in the user’s profile.
To return the user's first name or email address, use the CurrentUserFirstName or CurrentUserEmail function.
Syntax
CurrentUserFullName()
📘
CurrentUserFullName has no function arguments because it’s context-sensitive and doesn’t depend on any explicitly provided values.
Example
An admin applies a workbook as the custom homepage for their team. The workbook contains a text element with the message “Welcome” followed by a dynamic value that references the CurrentUserFullName function.
When John Wooden logs into Sigma, the custom homepage displays a “Welcome John Wooden” message.
Likewise, when Bill Walton logs in, the custom homepage displays a “Welcome Bill Walton” message.
