A button is a UI element that allows you to create a one-click action in a workbook. You can customize how a button is displayed and configure it to navigate to specific destinations, manage control values, modify or refresh elements, or download and export data.
This document explains how to create a button element and configure an action triggered by user clicks.
User requirements
The ability to create elements in a workbook requires the following:
You must be assigned an account type with the Full explore or Create, edit, and publish workbooks permission enabled.
You must be the workbook owner or be granted Can explore or Can edit workbook permission.
