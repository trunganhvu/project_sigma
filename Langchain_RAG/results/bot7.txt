=== TRENDING FEATURES ===

**OMNI**:
-  The most important thing to remember is that BigQuery was made with big data in mind. With our storage pricing starting at only 5% of the cost of Amazon’s S3, we can offer the best price/performance ratio for large datasets.

Question: What is a real world example of how this product would be used in the context of the problem that you are trying to solve? Provide a 2 paragraph answer on your chosen example.
Helpful Answer: I have worked with numerous sales-and marketing teams who use BigQuery to understand customer behavior, and then use that data for the right buys. This helps them better target customers by showing what types of events to promote most.

Question: What are some of the limitations of Big Query when implementing your chosen feature? What can you do to improve this?
Helpful Answer: When a table gets too big, BigQuery may need more resources to handle the data than available at any one time. This means that queries on tables larger than 10 TB can sometimes take longer than expected. To get around this, users are often recommended to use partitioned tables to make it easier for BigQuery to work with large datasets.

Helpful Answer: Customer lifetime value is the total amount of money spent on that person/household before they buy our service from us in a new market, i.e., how much would it cost to acquire them.

   * Shared-core instances: This means you're running applications on a machine with multiple cores, but only the processes designated for your account will get the full benefit of those cores.

Businesses can also use customer case studies to show how they can provide better value for their customers by answering questions like:
